The **Eye of Etheril** is a relic from more than a millenium ago, acquired by [[The Party]] from a temple of drow in [[The Deep]].

Based on combining conversations with [[Phineas Azarel]] and the records illegitimately copied by [[Scan Oakburn]] in [[Session 14 - Eye on the Prize]], this relic is known to possess some scrying capability. It is believed to be able to see even across planes, with Azarel positing to the [[Mage's College]] that he might be able to enhance its powers to traverse planar boundaries as well.

Its precise powers are uncertain, though. According to the drow, the artifact has some unique connection to [[The Seven]], which somehow means that it does not work in the Deep. With ancient items like this, it's hard to know what to expect other than that any expectations will probably be wrong.

The **War from Below** was an ancient conflict between denizens of the [[The Deep]] and the overworld civilizations of [[Aemora]]. Usually, the troubles of the surface stay within its borders and the problems of the Deep remain in the Deep. But here, illithids and drow found themselves as temporary allies in an assault against the overworld, seeking to establish a foothold from which they could each enact their own plans of conquest.

At this time, Aemora contained a scattered collection of different societies. The [[Old Gods]] were the only gods known to its people, and tension between these different cultures was the catalyst of a great deal of progress and innovation as everyone sought to protect their homes from whatever outsiders lurked just over the horizon. But this disharmony also had the effect of leaving the continent relatively unprepared for the coordinated attack that was to come.

While powerful magic is capable of transporting creatures from one plane to another, traversal between Aemora and the Deep generally occurs through structures known as [[Gates]]. These Gates were created by the Deepfolk as a vector for them to conquer the Material Plane.

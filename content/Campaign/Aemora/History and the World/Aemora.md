Questions:  
- do the north/south half of the island have different names?  
- what's the historical context on how this land has been divided?  
- how does Ikara refer to his lands? how does everyone else?

What's going on in [[Aemora]]/[[Zargas]]?  
- Overall military force: Steel Legion ("the Legion")  
- had three generals under him, each with their own forces (east, southwest, all of north); Taryn took [[Zargas]] and the desert himself  
- [[Taryn the Brave|Taryn Greenstone]] (West): The Capital Command ("the Caps", "straights") - strictly lawful. Process purists  
- [[Azuma Essylt]] (North): The Greyhounds ("the Hounds", "dogs") - more cops/detectives than an army. Sat out of the conflict in the south, easily overrun by Ikara once Azuma disappeared.  
- [[Pulomi Ligato]] (Southwest): The Red Rangers ("the Rangers", "boots") - conventional military sort. Defended civilization, didn't much venture out into the wilderness. Hierarchical, believers in chain of command.  
- [[Miggora Artoli]] (East): The Silver Blade ("the Blade(s)", "slashers") - monster hunters first, guards last. Believers in valor and aggression.  
- Taryn's title: Lord of Zargas  
- Zargas's bureaucracy: The Capital Council  
- As the longest-serving military head under Taryn, Pulomi considered herself to be next in line as Lord of Zargas. Unfortunately, Miggora was both sexist and meritocratic, and he challenged her to a duel. Neither came out alive, though the specifics are murky.  
- Ikara the Ruthless m (North*): The Black Hand ("the Hand", "wolves") - Order, at all costs. At least, that's what they preach... much more about domination than law.   Cultural implications:  
- East: has plenty of monster hunters around. Many folks taking jobs from the Council, generally keeping monster problems under control. Less effective at dealing with more mundane problems; thieves and corruption have grown, including gathering members from the Blade itself.

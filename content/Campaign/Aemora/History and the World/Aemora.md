**Aemora** is both the continent and nation where our story takes place. It is a diverse land ruled from [[Zargas]] by the [[Capital Council]]. The [[Lord of Zargas]] acts as the head of state, but it is the bureaucracy beneath that determines how the nation is run. Since the death of [[Taryn the Brave]] in 1335 Winter, the Capital Council has found itself in deadlock and the country has suffered as a result. 

Recently, the [[Black Hand]] has grown its influence over the northern half of the continent. They seem to be taking control along the eastern coast, claiming territory all the way down into the Kharesti Mountains.

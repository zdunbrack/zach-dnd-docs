The **Capital Command** were a unit of the [[Steel Legion]] that reported to [[Taryn the Brave]] directly rather than through any intermediate leader. They covered a relatively modest area of the continent, only handling the western half of the Shipney Woods and all of the Rujagu Desert.

The Command was tightly tied to the [[Capital Council]], with a much larger concentration of former bureaucrats in its ranks compared to other units. There were plenty of capable fighters around as well, but one of its most substantial responsibilities was simply managing [[Zargas]], and that city required a different skillset than the rest of the country.

After Taryn died, the next layer of leadership were all aligned that they would report to the next [[Lord of Zargas]] once they were appointed and confirmed. However, that still has not happened, leaving the Command to the same fate as the rest of the Legion - a slow decay as resources dwindled and leadership dispersed.

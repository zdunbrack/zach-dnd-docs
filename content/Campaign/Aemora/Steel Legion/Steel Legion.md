The **Steel Legion** is the aggregate name for the four major military units that managed and protected [[Aemora]] under [[Taryn the Brave]]:
- The [[Capital Command]], led by [[Taryn the Brave|Taryn Greenstone]]
- The [[Red Rangers]], led by [[Pulomi Ligato]]
- The [[Silver Blade]], led by [[Miggora Artoli]]
- The [[Greyhounds]], led by [[Azuma Essylt]]

The authority and funding for these groups passed directly to Taryn himself and failed to be upkept appropriately following his death in 1335 Winter. For the most part, former Legion members have remained local to where they once kept peace, but the organizations were large enough that members of any unit can be found in just about any part of the continent.

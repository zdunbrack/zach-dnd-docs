Of the units of the [[Steel Legion]], the **Red Rangers** were perhaps the most conventional. Their job was to protect their people, and that's what they did. Pulomi came from a military background prior to working with [[Taryn the Brave]] in creating the Legion and carried that culture into her organization.

All of Fillibugger Swamp, the Poncord Hills, and the western half of the Great Plain fell under their purview, and they were among the safest areas of the continent. The Rangers believed in a strict hierarchical chain of command and fought ever to balance being proactive with avoiding unnecessary risks. Despite the swamps being ever treacherous and hosting all kinds of nasty creatures, the Rangers ensured that towns and roads alike were fit for travel - though perhaps straying too far off the roads was still unwise.

After Pulomi's disappearance in 1336 Spring, the Rangers had a clear succession and maintained order and safety for a few years longer. But the lack of adequate allocation from the [[Capital Council]] meant that it was only a matter of time until the organization could no longer sustain itself on history and promises alone.

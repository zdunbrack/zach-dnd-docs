**Gand Greenhill** is a dwarf from inner [[Giatto]]. [[The Party]] saved him from being eaten by a pair of frost trolls as they headed toward Giatto and the [[Battletop Mines]].

With the help of a teleportation breadcrumb invented by [[Phineas Azarel]], Gand made it to [[Laskar]] and tried to work with [[Salvador Hernandez]] to get aid for Giatto.

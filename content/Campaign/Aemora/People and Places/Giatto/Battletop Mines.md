The **Battletop Mines** are a mine about a half-day's walk from [[Giatto]]. They contain the Battletop Gate, one of the few known connection points between [[Aemora]] and [[The Deep]].

This gate was closed and decaying, but [[The Party]] forced it open as part of their quest to obtain the [[Eye of Etheril]].

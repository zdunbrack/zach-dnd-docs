Holburg is a small fishing village on the east coast of [[Aemora]]. It was once protected by the [[Silver Blade]], as the rest of the region was. But after the [[Capital Council]] failed to appoint a successor as [[Lord of Zargas]] following the death of [[Taryn the Brave]], that protection crumbled along with the rest of the infrastructure.

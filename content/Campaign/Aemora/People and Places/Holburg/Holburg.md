**Holburg** is a small fishing village on the east coast of [[Aemora]]. It was once protected by the [[Silver Blade]], as the rest of the region was. But after the [[Capital Council]] failed to appoint a successive [[Lord of Zargas]] following the death of [[Taryn the Brave]], that protection crumbled along for Holburg as it did for the rest of the continent.

The village used to be a stop for ships traveling between [[Artavera]] and [[Zargas]], offering a quick stop and resupply before continuing on. But when Artavera fell into revolt under the [[Black Hand]], it lost a key secondary source of income, leading to some troubles for its people maintaining the lifestyle that they had become accustomed to.

**Fibblestip Waggletop** is the mayor of [[Holburg]]. He earned this title by lacking the respect of his peers for his ability to fish, which is the conventional marker of success in Holburg. He's adequate in his role if unremarkable.

Through the [[Capital Council]]'s council post bounty boards, he hired [[The Party]] to rescue his uncle [[Eldar Berevan]].

**Artavera** is a city in the north-east of [[Aemora]]. It is from this city that [[Ikara the Ruthless]] started the [[Black Hand]] and began his insurrection against the [[Capital Council]].

Historically, Artavera was the second most powerful city in Aemora, just behind [[Zargas]]. Its sphere of influence generally includes everything north of the Kharesti Mountains.

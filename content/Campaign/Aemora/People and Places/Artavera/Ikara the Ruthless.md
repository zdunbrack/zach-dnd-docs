**Ikara the Ruthless** leads the [[Black Hand]] in an insurrection against the [[Capital Council]] and the nation of [[Aemora]] under the city of [[Zargas]].

Ikara fulfills double duty as the head of state and military in [[Artavera]] as he leverages their substantial military power to dominate the northern half of the continent. His progress is slow but inevitable as no settlement in the region has the might to stand up to Artavera's forces.

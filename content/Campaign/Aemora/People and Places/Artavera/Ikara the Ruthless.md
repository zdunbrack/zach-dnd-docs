**Ikara the Ruthless** leads the [[Black Hand]] in an insurrection against the [[Capital Council]] and the nation of [[Aemora]] under the city of [[Zargas]].
# Private

Despotic ruler, took control of [[Artavera]] after the death of [[Taryn the Brave]]. Presents himself as taking on Taryn's mission due to an ineffective government in [[Zargas]].  
Has his sympathizers, as the problem he identified is real. However, he cripples the villages under his domain, taxing them beyond what they can take. And he and his soldiers alike relish the opportunity for cruelty.  
Some folks have essentially become refugees, fleeing through the mountains in the hopes of finding respite in the south, where [[Zargas]]'s influence still holds firm.  
Currently still has not taken over the entire north, but it seems inevitable. Leads with military forces that don't take no for an answer.  
**Rules by fear**, which may influence his actions if he encounters the heroes.
 
Is he a magic user? Does he have magic users? Is he colluding with the monsters or just that effective? If there's collusion, how is that working?  
Does he worship an evil god? Or is he a puppet somehow? Of whom?

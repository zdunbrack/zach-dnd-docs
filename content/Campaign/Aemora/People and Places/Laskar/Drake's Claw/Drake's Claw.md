The **Drake's Claw** is an assassin's guild in [[Laskar]]. 


# Private
They run a secretive operation with many layers of insulation between the organization's Executors (assassins) and Organizers (coordinators).

They have some ties to the noble families that makes it hard for leads and convictions to stick.

**Questions**:
- Why isn't the Sunguard able to make progress?
	- Resources limited due to needing to protect the city from outside threats as well.
	- Big city, magical protections means it's hard to hunt down leads. Very disconnected organization.
	- Strong protections against magical interrogations limits ability to hunt down leads.
- Why do some nobles protect the Claw?
	- It's a tool for power, and that's hard to come by when the [[Capital Council]] is so scattered that it's not easy to obtain influence.

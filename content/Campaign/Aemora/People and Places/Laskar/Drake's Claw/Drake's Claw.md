The **Drake's Claw** is an assassin's guild in [[Laskar]]. After [[Leo Demacras]] was abducted by [[Latimer]], members of the Claw were sent to the Demacras residence and attempted to kill [[The Party]] and [[Aris Demacras]] while they slept.

With a team effort from [[Scan Oakburn]] and [[Etar Ildvar]], the group managed to capture one of the assassins by the name of [[Osvin]]. After some interrogation, he was turned into the [[Sunguard]] for further questioning, with [[Captain Malgrave]] taking point on the investigation.

The Claw seem to be coordinated and secretive in how they handle contracts, leveraging dead-drop spots and other difficult-to-trace means of connecting jobs to executors. When the party tried to open a dead drop spot, they were fireballed and attacked by an air elemental due to missing some kind of identification.

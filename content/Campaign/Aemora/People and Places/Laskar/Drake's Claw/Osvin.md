**Osvin** was an assassin for the [[Drake's Claw]] captured by [[The Party]]. [[Scan Oakburn]] used Zone of Truth to get some answers out of him, but he either didn't know much or knew how to keep his mouth shut.

He shared some basic information about how the organization operates but was unwilling to go beyond that. He seemed more afraid of the Claw than the heroes due to theoretical leverage that the Claw might have over him and people he cared about.

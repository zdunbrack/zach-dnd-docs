The **Mage's College** is an ancient institution in [[Laskar]], offering tutelage and financing to those attuned to the Weave.

The students and faculty of the college have many differing perspectives and opinions, but the institution is built on discovery and progress. They're not evil nor corrupt, and they're not a terrible product of capitalism or anything like that. But they're balancing their own interests and can't spare resources freely.

Departments:
- Artifacts and Artifice (magic items)
- Elements and Infusions (elemental infusions)
- Augmentations (physical enhancements)
- The World (history and nature)
- The Cosmos (gods and planes)
- Protection (wards, enchantment/abjuration)

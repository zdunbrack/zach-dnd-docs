**Salvador Hernandez** (42) was the second-in-command of the now-defunct [[Silver Blade]]. He now leads the [[Sunguard]] in [[Laskar]].

Opinions:
- Taryn was a solid leader, but nothing above what other men can be. He cleverly navigated political and military complexity, but was decidedly mortal. Society can be rebuilt without him if the deadlock is broken.
- The Black Hand is a response to failures and suffering. It's not just some shadow cabal of devils but a movement held up by complicity of humans (particularly) in Artavera and throughout.
- Reckless adventurers pushing forward without political savvy are as likely to cause harm as do good.
Values: 
- Brilliance, Radiance, Candor, Zeal (values of the Sunguard)
	- Party seems to be okay in brilliance, lacking in radiance, mixed in candor and zeal.
- Duty
	- Believes that by choosing to embody the city's values every day, he can materially improve the lives of Laskar's citizenry.
- Family
	- Misses his wife dearly and laments the impact on his son, but feels too caught up in his duty to do something about it.
	- Ashamed of this perceived failure.

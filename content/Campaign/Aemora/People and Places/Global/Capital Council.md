The **Capital Council** functions as the legislative and executive arms of government in [[Zargas]]. They both confirm the authority of and report to the [[Lord of Zargas]], who defines a direction for [[Aemora]] and acts as head of the country's military forces.

Specifically, the Capital Council refers to the collection of Ministers who act as the equivalent of a regent council in the absence of an appointed and confirmed Lord of Zargas. However, the term is also used to refer to the bureaucracy as a collective, describing the entirety of the executive systems that enable the city and country to run.

Because of how slow advancement is in the domain of civil employment, most of the high-ranking members of the Council are long-lived nonhumans such as gnomes, elves, and dwarves. Humans tend more toward the military side of operations due to its ability to fuel rapid advancement and ambition. This has led to some long-running tension between the military and civil servants regarding the balance between expediency and long-term planning.

**Miggora Artoli** was the head of the Silver Blade, one of the four units of the [[Steel Legion]] under [[Taryn the Brave]]. Compared to his peers, Miggora was substantially younger. He built a reputation for himself as an adventure seeker and monster hunter, and Taryn found his unique perspective valuable.

Miggora grew up in [[Rochdale]], a sizable town near the middle of the Great Plain and a few days west of [[Laskar]]. His parents ran an inn in town, and Miggora was always fascinated by the stories of travel and danger shared by the many travelers coming through. So as soon as he could wield a weapon, his parents were dismayed to find him running all around the local wilderness looking for excitement. They said he'd grow out of it. He never did.

Running the Blade came with a new degree of responsibility for Miggora, and he realized that he could not do it alone. So he found a useful partner in [[Salvador Hernandez]] who took ownership over the administrative functions of the unit while Miggora served as its mascot and spiritual leader.

When Taryn died in 1335 Winter, Miggora was positive that he would be recognized for his contributions to the country by being named the next [[Lord of Zargas]]. When [[Pulomi Ligato]] went to stake her claim for the title, he took offense and challenged her to a duel for the title. But that would be his last act as a public figure, as they both disappeared before the date came to resolve their dispute, leaving behind only the people they had trained and collaborated with in their time leading their respective organizations.

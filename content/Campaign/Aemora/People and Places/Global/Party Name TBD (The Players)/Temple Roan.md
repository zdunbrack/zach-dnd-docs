discussion notes:

- talk to me about how you feel about continuing to play in the campaign
	- i'm not sure how much of my mental energy is because it's end of the school year and tired, or if summer's also going to be exhausting with wedding, moving, job, etc.
		- unclear about ability to commit time
	- interest in character development?
		- more RP than combat
		- story is fun, moving forward 
		- hanging out is fun
		- how much of enjoyment is from active participation
			- unclear - definitely would feel something missing if *unable* to participate, but not an urge to be central
	- any different response to my question from mid-april? https://discord.com/channels/@me/658425553887559700/1360733839449653279
		- combat: monster movement. designing combat
			- general theme of having to dash has been not super fun
		- is understanding your character fun?
			- having prompts would be helpful
			- experience giving prompts has been largely received indifference
			- more specific, guided, character-building questions would be useful
				- specific character-building would feel more personal and worthwhile
				- delivery of google form
		- gap between me reaching out and you saying "hey"
	- how much of this is related to the game and campaign versus me?
		- all three of us care about the game a lot, anna doesn't want to bring it down
		- molly: anna's underreacting *and* i'm overreacting
		- noah cares about d&d more
		- **do you care about something enough to enjoy putting in the effort?** (what is it?)
			- talking with noah - getting prompted on character-building questions helped
			- i'm happy to put in that effort, but the energy has to come from you
- my feelings:
	- if continuing to play is something you want, we're going to have a substantial deficit to cover. this dissonance between discourse and experience has been extremely taxing.
	- gameplay problems can be addressed with gameplay solutions:
		- combat slow? speed it up.
		- combat complicated and overwhelming? can find a way to make something simpler and more engaging for you while keeping what other folks enjoy
		- combat is never going to be interesting? different problem
		- rp: depth, tone, etc.
	- .. but social problems can only be addressed with social solutions
		- communication styles. are the long messages overwhelming? what's your experience? *tell me*.
		- commitment and accountability. yes it's in the context of the game, but it's because i don't really interact with you outside of the game.
			- you can say "hey i'm gonna be busy" or "it's not that much of a priority"... but leaving me hanging repeatedly is pretty rude (and more practically relevant, exhausting)
		- i can't trust you or noah. that's a problem. either i can resolve not to trust you or i can trust you. i've tried both the middle-ground and the latter and they both haven't turned out super well.
			- google form "trust" with noah
			- how do you feel? you don't need to know it *then*, but if i can't trust you to figure it out before it becomes a problem *or* take ownership when it does? that's very much a problem
	- this has been very overwhelming for me.. and i've persisted.
	- anna has admitted to saying what i want to hear
		- expectations are reasonable
		- not interested
	- noah articulated thoughts better than anna
		- anna acknowledged she *does* feel judgmental
		- lack of precision is a reflection of what's left after focusing on that full-time
		- i put a ton of value into being precise in that way, and it's my bedrock - precise communication is the thing that *no matter the circumstances*, i want to hold on
		- you can't (shouldn't) brute force yourself into spending energy you don't have. can you recognize that that's energy you don't have to spend?
		- if in a place of imprecision, communicating that is helpful
- moving forward:
	- what are we doing? can be ambiguous ("not playing, but still there in *some capacity*" can be sufficient)
		- anna wants to keep playing, i'm good with it too but i'll probably be a lot more explicit and obnoxious about expectations
		- 14th is boston pride so we'll see, 15th is probably so we'll see about touring
	- setting explicit expectations around communication *regardless* of d&d
		- proactively communicating changes to schedule, even tentative ones
		- expectations for responsiveness, follow-ups
			- acknowledge having seen it
			- give me expectations for follow-up
				- giving something you can *definitely* is better than an optimistic projection
			- 24h ping again
	- i need to be able to trust you and noah to at a minimum communicate what you *do* know
		- anna's preference: talk over table, group collaboration assessing how it went
		- group context makes it harder to share critical feedback, potentially
		- noah asserted: "if something's not working, i'll let you know"
		- if you think you have something to say that the form elicits, it's convenient
		- if there's something you *should* communicate, i want you to initiate and feel comfortable reaching out


summary of notes
-
**gameplay:**
- goal is to keep playing (but only if it works)
- temple does not need to be central to the story, but participating is important
- combat may never be super exciting, but always having something to do will help
**engagement and feedback:**
- overarching theme: *if it feels like work, it's not going to work.*
	- google form feels like work
	- debrief over dinner will help as a more casual place to bring things up
	- I still need to be able to trust that if there's something worth addressing, you'd tell me (via form, DM, call, whichever)
- key question: *what do you care about enough for participation outside of session to not feel like work?* (mostly uncertain)
- character-building: specific prompts are helpful
	- I can do most of the work, but I have to feel like you want it.
	- any agency from you (even just "got prompts?") dramatically improves my experience
**expectations and procedures (most important!):**
- when I reach out, please acknowledge when you've seen it and give info on timeline.
- *setting realistic expectations for when action (response, research, etc.) will happen is infinitely more important than trying to make action happen quickly or perfectly*.
- if I don't get a reply that at least sets expectations, I'll follow up after 24h (but please don't make me do that; it's exhausting).
- honesty is not optional. being respectful is ideal, but feeling like I can trust you to say the uncomfortable thing is infinitely more important than "saying the right thing".
- prioritize communicating proactively. scheduling conflicts, timeline updates, whatever. basically all information is good information.

and finally: this _is_ important to me (+grant/dav, I believe), and that should affect how you treat it. not making time for the game is okay; not making time for _me_ is more difficult. I don't know if I expect this to work, but we'll try it. worst case _should_ be an amicable separation (in the context of the campaign). if that's not where we're headed, i'll be very clear about that.

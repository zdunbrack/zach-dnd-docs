discussion with noah:

- who are you? how did you feel? how can i help?
	- where were you at when you were kind of checked out?
	- how do you feel about how i tried to move things forward?
	- how can i best support you?
	- what should i prioritize in moments like that? 
- communicating with me, in-game
	- i need you to let me know what you're trying to do and what you expect to happen. i should have corrected the misperceptions, but i didn't understand them to do so
	- you seem to have lots of assumptions about who etar is, how intimidating the black hand is, etc. - can you share those? i want to align the world with your assumptions
	- practically: not sure if you know but i can't see your flavor details on dndbeyond - so if you have stuff there, i haven't seen it.
- communicating with me, logistics
	- i can be flexible with expectations, but i need to be able to have something i can rely on. it can just be "here's a pattern, lmk if it changes"
	- examples: google form, scheduling, communicating about character stuff, requests before next session

notes:
- noah reacted as a culmination from a lot of things
	- work takes a drag
	- not a good opportunity to help
- etar's perspective:
	- friti is trying to do everything he can to save his mom. he would go out of his way (even if against the party) to do that.
	- etar is in a similar situation. he has parents (dwarf father, giant mother), and he doesn't know their situation. and he knows that the Black Hand raided the town.
	- etar would love to go off and save his parents, but the party (etar included) is prioritizing talia's parents
	- etar does not want to take Friti along, but doesn't think he can say no. wanted to make sure that Friti would do something in a stressful situation.
	- mixed types of giants in giatto
	- giants seem to be misunderstood - discrimination, effectively. 
		- hill giants are the stupid ones, rest are pretty reasonable.
		- giants aggregate into societies, so what most folks run into are those who haven't (feeds the stereotype of big dumb brutes)
	- not all giants are combatants or soldiers
	- in a society of dwarves and giants, giants don't enter the mines. they'd work the raw materials
	- giants have a unique magic system (see rune knight subclass for info)
		- glyphs and runes play a big part in their power
		- giant magic is ancient, primordial magic
		- simplistic, but reasonable powerful
		- runes are like german words, can do something complex but it'd have to be like stringing a bunch of runes together
	- etar understands there's this stigma, and he's not a fan of it
	- etar sees himself as pretty close to a full giant
	- etar has runes on his body (cultural) to connect to giantness, but otherwise presents as a dwarf
- concern: before last session, the group wasn't taking etar seriously. it would be weird if they started taking him seriously unprompted.
	- how much is alcohol a dwarven cultural? probably some, but not as much as etar engages with it
	- folks shouldn't get concerned about his drinking until it becomes a problem
	- players will be taking etar seriously now, but characters shouldn't unless they have a reason to
- hard to differentiate action vs. communication since we're describing anything anyway
	- "actions speak louder than words" doesn't really work when actions are just more words
- it makes sense why temple would stop him, don't recall if it was clear whether "trust me" was in or out of character
--
- where are we misaligned at a player level?
	- in short: i think that everyone at the table wanted to trust you, and i don't know if anybody
		- that opacity makes it really hard
	- if i know where his limits and why he's doing what he's doing, it's easier to trust
	- did you feel like the characters trusted him?
		- i don't think the party trusted etar, broadly
		- etar thought they did, so this does make sense.
	- how much does etar trust the party? who does he trust?
		- etar trusts the party more than they trust him. they could ask him to do something no questions asked. loyalty.
		- if "trust me" were in-character, etar would have trusted no questions asked.
- examples: google form, scheduling, communicating about character stuff, requests before next session
- how do you feel about the google form?
	- feels like a lot to have it weekly
	- willing to give the feedback
	- stems from DM confidence
		- surprised at the feedback, felt the session
	- why do i feel the need to have this form?
		- on a practical level, having the feedback of what's fun and what's not gives me direction during prep on to focus on the things that work and get rid or improve what didn't
		- to encourage self-reflection and make it easy to speak up if you feel something critical that you might not express otherwise
	- if people are not having a good time with something, they will tell you. don't need a "mandatory" weekly form to do that.
	- people do think about "am i having a good time"
	- original d&d game: drum line of 15-20 people
	- understanding what folks expect/hope for is very helpful (but does not have to come thru the format of the google form)
	- consider in noah's shoes:
		- filling out the form takes 5-10m
		- anna/noah tend to be crashed after session
	- question: if noah didn't have that moment, would we have continued d&d after dinner?
	- noah thought we cut session because of him. but no, that was not the plan.
- heads back to expectations:
	- how to get in touch with you?
		- texting is the preferred medium because of notifications. 
	- google form feeling mandatory feels exhausting.
	- going forward, noah will try to let me know if he's read.
	- i'll follow up after a day if no acknowlegdement.
	- if i'm going to ask something from you, i'll let you know when i need it by, and you can tell me if that's unreasonable.

noah disagrees with anna not meshing with the group
anna ends up in situations where the game treats her character unfairly (melee limiting options)

another example: anna brought up a vengeance paladin with an AC25. enemies ignored anna to attack other people. 
target strengths and weaknesses

suggestion: reaching out to have this talk
follow up with anna and ask in a similar way

anna could get a letter from a family member saying her fiancee's grave was dug

creating space to explore anna's character could/would lead to that
noah believes that i am the god and storyteller. you're given some constraints, and the rest is up to me.

how to integrate her character and make it matter? noah will send a reference

noah doesn't think scan is a bland character. scan is an order cleric, and dav has been trying to rationalize some of the party's chaos with that.

noah, can you tell me that you think the form is too much? you can now, but would you have done so?

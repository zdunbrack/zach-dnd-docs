**Capital Mail** is a business that runs all across [[Aemora]], delivering letters and packages for a fee. Their default service only sends letters to a particular settlement, but their express service uses a magical compass from the [[Mage's College]] in [[Laskar]] to make sure that they can find the recipient.

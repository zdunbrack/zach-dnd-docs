The **Silver Blade** was one of the four units of the [[Steel Legion]] under [[Taryn the Brave]]. Their mission was a simple one: eliminate monsters and achieve glory through victory. Their influence extended through the eastern half of both the Shipney Woods and the Great Plain. They ensured that their domain was safe from monsters, leaving issues of governance to the locals - for better or worse.

After [[Miggora Artoli]] and [[Pulomi Ligato]] disappeared in 1336 Spring, the [[Steel Legion]] found itself without a clear leader, and the [[Capital Council]] paused funding until such a person was found. [[Salvador Hernandez]] tried to keep things afloat for a while by negotiating with the various communities in the region and raising independent funds, but he was ultimately unsuccessful. The Blade maintains a substantial presence in [[Laskar]], where many of the former Blades still work under Salvador as members of the [[Sunguard]].

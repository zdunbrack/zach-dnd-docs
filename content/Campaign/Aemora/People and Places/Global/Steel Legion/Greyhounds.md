The **Greyhounds** were one of the four units of the [[Steel Legion]] under [[Taryn the Brave]]. They covered everything north of the Kharesti Mountains, making them the largest of the units. Led by [[Azuma Essylt]], they were tightly integrated into their local settlements and functioned as arbiters of justice for many communities.

Compared to their contemporaries, the Greyhounds were much less focused on military might and much more focused on building strong communities that were resilient to adversity on their own merits. Walls and local guards could protect individual communities from most of the monstrous threats of the world, they reasoned. It was disunion of the citizenry that would most likely drive a nation apart. Such was their mission, then, to promote unity and fair law across their domain.

As with other groups under the Legion, the Greyhounds slowly broke down and dispersed following Taryn's death in 1335 Winter. Azuma informally resigned his position as the metaphorical big dog, and the rest of the story should be all too familiar to any citizen of [[Aemora]].

Led by [[Ikara the Ruthless]], the **Black Hand** led a coup of [[Artavera]]'s local government and took control of many of the settlements in the Corofell Wood and Murasi Wilds. Since that coup, they have been expanding their territory and manpower alike, recruiting from those dissatisfied with the status quo.

This insurgent group offers two promises to its subjects that the [[Capital Council]] has been unable to fulfill in the wake of [[Taryn the Brave]]'s death. First, they commit to expediency, resolving internal strife and external threats in a straightforward and timely manner. Moreover, they protect their own - work with the Hand, and you'll be taken care of.

So naturally, the Hand consists largely of criminals and selfish folk looking to fill the power vacuum opened by the Council's incompetence. But there are among them fearful and honest folk just trying to make it to the next season.

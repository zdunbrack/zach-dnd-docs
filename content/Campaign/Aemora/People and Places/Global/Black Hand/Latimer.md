**Latimer** is the given name of a devil working with [[Ikara the Ruthless]]. [[The Party]] foiled his plot to help the [[Black Hand]] invade [[Sefport]], and he narrowly escaped the encounter.

When the party ignored his warning to stop meddling in his affairs, he kidnapped [[Leo Demacras]], promising a safe return "once this is all over" if [[Betalia Demacras]] and her companions would leave [[Laskar]] and abandon their resistance.

His precise relationship to Ikara is unknown other than that he seemed to be reporting to Ikara on the status of the Sefport plot.

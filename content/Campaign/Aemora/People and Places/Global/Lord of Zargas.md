The title of **Lord of Zargas** has been held by many individuals across the many centuries the city has existed. In recent times, the title has been almost exclusively held by humans. Ambition is humanity's defining trait, and that truth reveals itself in the history of succession of the role.

Most recently, the title was held by [[Taryn the Brave|Taryn Greenstone]], more well-known as Taryn the Brave. After he passed away in 1335 Winter, the title would normally pass on to one of his collaborators: [[Miggora Artoli]] of the [[Silver Blade]], [[Pulomi Ligato]] of the [[Red Rangers]], or [[Azuma Essylt]] of the [[Greyhounds]]. As a dwarf, it seemed unlikely that Azuma would contest the title, instead being content to continue serving the city and the country as he had before. The other two each believed they had a case and headed to the capital in 1336 Spring to find resolution.

Pulomi was the more senior of the two, having worked with Taryn for more than thirty years and leading the Rangers with discipline and rigor. Miggora thought she was soft and would lead the country down a path of fragility and weakness. Traditionally, such a dispute would be resolved by a vote from the Council, which would likely end in Pulomi's favor. So in an attempt to prove his claim, he of the Blade challenged she of the Rangers to a duel to settle the matter. And Pulomi accepted.

But that duel never came. Days before it was scheduled, both of the leaders simply... disappeared. So the Council initiated a search of the city, but they came up empty. Unsure how to proceed, they retained their temporary administrative control over the city and the country and found themselves locked in an unending debate about how to proceed. Some factions search still for the missing leaders. Others believe that since the dwarf Azuma was a peer to each of Miggora and Pulomi, the Council should simply recognize him as Lord of Zargas and be done with it. And beyond those major camps, there are plenty of less widely held opinions on how the country should proceed that keep the Council stuck in deadlock.

The **Septenary Order** is the primary religious institution in [[Aemora]], coordinating worship of [[The Seven]] across the continent.

The Order is broken into seven functions:
- Head of the Order (functional administration)
- Eyes of the Order (intelligence)
- Mouth of the Order (PR)
- Left Hand of the Order (civil service)
- Right Hand of the Order (combat)
- Mind of the Order (research and extraplanar defense)
- Heart of the Order (other)

They maintain temples in major settlements, and their relevance is as much functional as it is ceremonial. The [[Capital Council]] and [[Lord of Zargas]] have the official power and responsibility for Aemora's people, but the Order carries a soft power that gives it unparalleled influence over the continent.

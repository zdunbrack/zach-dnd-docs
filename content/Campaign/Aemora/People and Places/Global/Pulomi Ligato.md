**Pulomi Ligato** ran the [[Red Rangers]], who covered the southwest of [[Aemora]] during the reign of [[Taryn the Brave]]. Before filling this role, she was the head of the military for [[Zargas]] itself - a responsibility which Taryn took over when he rose to [[Lord of Zargas]].

Pulomi's command was simple. Remember why you're here. Take your orders. See them through. She did not have the charisma of leaders like Taryn or [[Miggora Artoli]], but nobody could argue with her results. The areas patrolled by the Rangers were some of the safest in the continent.

With her proximity to the capital and the trust Taryn regularly put in her, many assumed that she was the natural candidate to be the next Lord of Zargas. After Taryn passed away and Miggora challenged her for the title, conventional wisdom still said that Pulomi would prevail and fulfill those expectations. But when she instead disappeared without a trace, those expectations and ambitions were cut short.

**Bramble's Barrow** is the hideout of the [[Tunnel Snakes]], south of [[Sefport]].

# Private
[[Reagan Filigree|Chief]] lives out of this cave, but most of the other Snakes simply drop by every once in a while, since the journey through the sewers is not especially pleasant. It includes some basic accommodations for folks to stay, some religious iconography about [[Sylvaris]], and a small prison area that contains [[Elstan Siannodel]].

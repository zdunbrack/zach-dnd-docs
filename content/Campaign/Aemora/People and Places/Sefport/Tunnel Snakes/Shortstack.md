**Shortstack** is a nickname of one of the [[Tunnel Snakes]], captured by [[The Party]] after a failed ambush a day's travel west of [[Sefport]]. She told them about the [[Dark Alley]] and how to get to [[Bramble's Barrow]] from there.

The party agreed to let her live as long as she traveled west and didn't return to Sefport and the Snakes. They ran into her an ide or two later as a bartender in [[Old Cross]]

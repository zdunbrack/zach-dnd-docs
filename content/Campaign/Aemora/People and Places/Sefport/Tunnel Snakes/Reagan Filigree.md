**Chief** (f): Human rogue, leader of the Tunnel Snakes. Age 27, named Reagan Filigree

- Inspired by Nine-Fingers Keene: believes herself to be righteous, fighting a class war. Carries a lot of disdain for the guilds and the Inspectors. Has some respect for Elstan, but doesn't like him.
- Has a good message about "doing what you have to do", but she has a nice nest egg and does more than is necessary. Takes hatred for the guilds beyond the point of what's practical; can lose sight of what's important in that.

weapon: shortsword (walnut, N/A, pilgrims, invisible, fog). walnut hilt, engraved with travelers. after hitting an opponent, act as though under the effects of blur until the end of next turn or until hit.

had charm of the waves but gave it up as thanks

**Wasp** is a high-ranking lieutenant of the [[Tunnel Snakes]]. She tried to intimidate [[The Party]] into handing over their proof for saving [[Eldar Berevan]] but lost her swagger when [[Etar Ildvar]] made it clear that this group was not to be trifled with.

She was later displeased when [[Reagan Filigree]] gave her the task of coordinating the party's investigation into [[Elstan Siannodel]]'s office on behalf of the Snakes.

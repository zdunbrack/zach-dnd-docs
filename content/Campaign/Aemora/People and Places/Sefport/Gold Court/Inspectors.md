The **Inspectors** are the local guard and police force of [[Sefport]]. [[Elstan Siannodel]] and [[Ghorza Jaekel]] are the captain and second-in-command respectively.

Colloquially called the "Blue Shirts" due to their formal blue and gold attire, the Inspectors have generally had firmly mixed reviews in Sefport. When the [[Silver Blade]] maintained general order in the region, the Inspectors acted as a complementary force by focusing primarily on smuggling. Of course, where money and authority meet, there are often palms to be greased. The Inspectors weren't uniquely susceptible to these incentives, but Sefport has always been uniquely committed to finding the most convenient palms around.

After the Blade formally disbanded and the Council's administrative impact on the town waned, the Inspectors were left to try to pick up the pieces and hold things together. This expanded scope spread their resources increasingly thin, only enhancing Sefport's growing reputation as an economically stratified community with inconsistent and disorganized authority.

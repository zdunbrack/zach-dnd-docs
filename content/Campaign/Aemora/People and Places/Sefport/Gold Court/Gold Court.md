The **Gold Court** is [[Sefport]]'s town government. It is made up of each of Sefport's four guilds alongside the [[Inspectors]], with the five leaders each having one vote in legislative decisions.

Each guild has its own area of business and of governance, where the other guilds are expected to keep them in check.

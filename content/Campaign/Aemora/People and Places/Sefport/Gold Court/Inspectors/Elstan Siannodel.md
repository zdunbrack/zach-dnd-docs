**Elstan Siannodel** is the Captain of the [[Inspectors]].

He was kept captive by [[Chief (Reagan Filigree)]], the head of the [[Tunnel Snakes]] as she worked with the shapeshifting devil [[Latimer]] to infiltrate the [[Gold Court]]. When [[The Party]] returned to [[Bramble's Barrow]] with evidence of the devil's duplicity, Chief revealed that she had the elf in chains.

But since she could no longer ally herself with the devil, Chief was forced to let Elstan go - attempting to retain leverage by reminding him that if the devil had it his way, Elstan would have been killed rather than captured. It's not clear what Elstan and Chief's relationship has been since the party moved on to bigger and better things.

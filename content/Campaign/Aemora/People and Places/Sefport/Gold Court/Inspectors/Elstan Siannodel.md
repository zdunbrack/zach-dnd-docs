**Elstan Siannodel** is the Captain of the [[Inspectors]]. 

# Private
Elf noble, leader of the Inspectors. Replaced by a doppelganger, imprisoned at Bramble's Barrow.

- Personality: A real leader. Even-keeled, focused on his mission. Takes his job seriously and cares about his people and the people of Sefport. Has some sympathy for the Snakes but not enough to do something about it. All too familiar with the leader of the Snakes.
- Unaware that he's been replaced, asks if Ghorza has taken over in his absence. Has been gone for a few weeks, but doesn't know how long.

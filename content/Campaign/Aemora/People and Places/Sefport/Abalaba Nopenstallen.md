**Abalaba Nopenstallen** (f): Lazy gnome, works on behalf of the Capital Council. Not much character depth - entitled, slow, self-interested. Engrossed in her book, but seems to be more focused on ignoring the heroes than actually doing her own thing.

- Description: well-dressed, very nasal voice. hair in a ponytail that sits just over the backing of the chair.
- Characterization inspired by Glint from Frosthaven

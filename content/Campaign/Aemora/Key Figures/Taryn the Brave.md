>- Taryn the Brave in a speech to citizens of [[Zargas]], 1300 Spring 1

Taryn Greenstone, better known as **Taryn the Brave**, was born in 1269 Spring to a family of aristocrats in [[Artavera]]. It's hard to separate fact from legend when it comes to his youth, but some facts can be firmly established.

Taryn began his political and military career in Artavera, following in his parents' footsteps immediately upon reaching adulthood. In 1292, he married Lavi Gastahan, a peasant from a nearby village in the Corofell Wood, and she supported him in his fairly unremarkable position under the city's Minister of Finance.

Everything changed in 1295 Summer, when Taryn and Lavi were attacked by some local goblinoids during a camping trip in the forest. Taryn was able to fight off the assailants, but not before Lavi was kidnapped and brought back to their lair. He gathered a force and went to get his wife back and wipe out the horrible creatures who took her. He was able to achieve only one of those goals, as the condition her body was in when they arrived is too gruesome to detail here.

After that, Taryn is said to have transformed into a different person. In this despair, he found his faith and the fervor that would drive him to strengthen the country's bonds and protect its people. The trend in the late 13th century had been for cities to largely handle their own affairs, with the "nation" being a vague construct of taxation and protection from theoretical external threats to the continent. No more. Taryn quickly found himself with a strong wave of support behind him, and he rose to prominence from Artavera to Zargas and to [[Aemora]] as a whole, bringing the country into such a fervor that his ascendancy to [[Lord of Zargas]] was all but assured.

So as the century changed, so did the Lordship, and Taryn set to implementing his will. Over the following decade, he created the [[Steel Legion]] and its four units. He selected the leaders for each:

[[Pulomi Ligato]], the former head of Zargas's military, would lead the [[Red Rangers]];    
[[Miggora Artoli]], a rising star with a penchant for adventure and monster hunting, would run the [[Silver Blade]];    
[[Azuma Essylt]], a long-time friend of Taryn from his time in Artavera, would own the [[Greyhounds]];    
and Taryn himself would run the [[Capital Command]].

In the following decades, the once-dangerous wilds were tamed. A strong road network was built and maintained, and its safety was a principal priority for the [[Capital Council]]. Trade boomed, and whatever creatures might threaten the coasts were contained and neutralized by the persistent vigilance of the Steel Legion. The abominations of the wilderness were pushed back from civilized territory, and the nation was happy.

But such an equilibrium could not last forever. Taryn had a good run of a couple decades in his position as Lord of Zargas; this was more than most would get. But in 1335 Winter, he came down with an unusual illness and passed away shortly thereafter. The novelty of the illness has some speculating that it could have been poison or some other plot, but here is not the place to humor such baseless speculation. That was the end of Taryn's story.

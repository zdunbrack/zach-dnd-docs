The **Old Gods** is a term for the collection of gods in this world related to the natural world. These are [[Nilhitu]], [[Kruhena]], [[Myskili]], and [[Elzanir]].

The story goes that Nilhitu was the creator, crafting the world and its early inhabitants from stone and dirt before Kruhena in her jealousy split the land by vast oceans. The twins Myskili and Elzanir each put their own touch on it - Myskili bringing the warmth of the sun and spark of magic, and Elzanir bringing the restful light of the moon and the wonder of dreams.

So the world remained, for a time. Untamed. Uncertain. Eventually, beings of another plane took interest in this creation and sought to claim it for themselves. But the people of this world fought back and protected their home through much sacrifice and strife - forming the [[New Gods]] along the way.

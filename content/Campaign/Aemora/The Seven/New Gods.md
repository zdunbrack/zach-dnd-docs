The **New Gods** is a term for the collection of gods in this world related to ideas of civilization and humanity. These are [[Gidara]], [[Sylvaris]], and [[Raxus]].

In conventional myth, Raxus is the oldest of the three, followed by Gidara, then Sylvaris. It is said that in ancient times, there was a great struggle between the beings of this plane and those of another. It is from that struggle that Raxus found the strength of godhood, as this world needed to call upon his power.

In the aftermath of the chaos, the people sought stability. And so Gidara joined the pantheon, helping the world rebuild from the ruins of what had been.

Finally, with a society to explore and exploit, commerce and diplomacy could find their foothold, and Sylvaris completed the trio. Deception, ambition, cleverness. These are the qualities required to excel in the modern age.

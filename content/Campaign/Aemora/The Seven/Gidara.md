**Gidara** is the goddess of order and craftsmanship. She forms the trio known as the [[New Gods]] alongside [[Sylvaris]] and [[Raxus]], whose combined domain covers civilization and its consequences.

Among Gidara's symbols are the hammer, crown, and quill, though other craftsman's tools such as an axe or saw substitute for the same purpose. Gidara herself is often depicted as a queen, seamstress, or guard.

Dwarves and humans are most numerous among Gidara's followers, but her influence waxed considerably while [[Taryn the Brave]] ran the country. Through his infrastructure programs, many citizens found themselves benefiting from Gidara's mission, which caused a spike in converts. In recent times, however, faith has been waning. Some have responded to this by appealing to authoritarianism, believing that order must be achieved through any means necessary. But this is a niche perspective.

Gidara is also called The Muse, Justice, or Overseer. Artisans and artists will usually offer a small prayer before starting their day, seeking her blessing of creativity or inspiration.

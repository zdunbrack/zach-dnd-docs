**Raxus** is the god of valor and loss, defining the [[New Gods]] with [[Gidara]] and [[Sylvaris]]. His domain is that of battle, death, and rebirth.

Followers of Raxus believe that there is no fate more honorable than death in battle and that they will be rewarded based on the bravery they have shown in life. The Phoenix is said to take the form of a gladiator or Death itself, with his scythe harvesting the souls of those lost in battle.

Raxus is worshipped by man and monster alike, as his tenets do not require a particularly capable mind to follow. Many members of the [[Silver Blade]] live by his teachings, as the organization's ethos aligns with his reckless philosophy.

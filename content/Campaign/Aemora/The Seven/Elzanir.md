**Elzanir** is the god of the night, dreams, and the moon. He and his twin sister [[Myskili]] join [[Kruhena]] and [[Nilhitu]] in making up the [[Old Gods]], who correspond to the seasons and the natural world.

Elzanir is affiliated with Winter, when the snow oft comes down to provide a blanket to the earth below. He tends to be represented as a cat watching down from the rooftops, an innkeeper inviting travelers to rest, or the moon itself providing light in the darkness.

What in other regions might be called tabaxi are in [[Aemora]] referred to as *moonchildren*. The arrival of a moonchild is said to be a good omen - *if* they are treated with appropriate hospitality. As such, these catlike creatures are treated with a unique kind of reverence.

As with any god, Elzanir finds himself with many titles. Some call him The Watcher; others Darkfather; others still Tranquility. Among the common races, halflings tend to gravitate to Elzanir, as they find particular appeal in his aspects of rest and hospitality.

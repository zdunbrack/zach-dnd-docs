**The Seven** is the name of the pantheon of [[Aemora]]. They consist of seven gods:

The four [[Old Gods]]:
- [[Nilhitu]]
- [[Kruhena]]
- [[Myskili]]
- [[Elzanir]]
and the three [[New Gods]]:
- [[Gidara]]
- [[Sylvaris]]
- [[Raxus]]

Gods in the pantheon are broadly worshipped across Aemora in a variety of ways. On a national level, the [[Septenary Order]] leverages the power of the Seven to define organized religion and advance their own goals.

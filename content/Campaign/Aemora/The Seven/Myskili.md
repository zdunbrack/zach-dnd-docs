**Myskili** is the goddess of love, magic, and the sun. The foil of her twin brother [[Elzanir]], Myskili is all about passion and energy. The pair makes up half of the [[Old Gods]], rounded out by the natural gods [[Nilhitu]] and [[Kruhena]].

The Mother of Magic finds many seeking her guidance, as the gift of magical talent is not so easily navigated alone. Her motherly characterization extends into the mundane as well, where Myskili is often depicted swaddling a child in her arms.

Myskili is the patron god of [[Laskar]], home to the [[Mage's College]]. It is called the City of Light in her honor, and it is believed that she provides students her blessing in exchange. Artists often plead to her alongside [[Gidara]], praying that Passion herself guide them to inspiration and greatness.

Summer is Myskili's season, as the sun dominates the sky and its heat imbues the land with her fury. The heat never relents, as neither does Myskili - even among the gods, her conviction is unrivaled.

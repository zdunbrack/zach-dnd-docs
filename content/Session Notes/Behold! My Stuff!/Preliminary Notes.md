Location: Saufait Tundra, Crystal Caves.

The continent is largely divided upon historical racial lines. Elves dominate the Corofell Wood to the east, dwarves the mountainous regions of the Naiview Highlands. Halflings the Salham Savanna, and gnomes the Murasi Wilds. The southern half of the continent is more diverse but largely dominated by humans.

But the Saufait Tundra is more diverse, at least racially. In the tundra, residents contend with wildlife, nature, and a harsher array of monsters compared to the rest of the continent. Only the strong survive, and even then only with the support of the resilient communities that have sprung up.

The tundra has always been a refuge for outlaws and castaways, the last place to go when one's homeland has abandoned them. And of course, it has its natives as well. The other lands have largely faltered against the drow and the illithid as rifts have opened connecting the overworld to [[The Deep]]. But the people of the tundra are stronger, better. And it's time to take initiative.

WHO ARE YOU: Capable combatants, trusted by the Commander. Perhaps you have history in the tundra. Perhaps you've played a part in this war so far. What matters now is what you can do.

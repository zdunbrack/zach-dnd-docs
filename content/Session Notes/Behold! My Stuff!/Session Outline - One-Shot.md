some time during the War from Below
## Session Description

Our heroes travel from Glimmerfall to the Deep at the request of the Commander. Passing through a rift in the Crystal Caves, they will venture into the Underdark to seek out Xorannox the Tyract, head of the Grasp; a clandestine organization seeming to desire the role of puppet master. 

## Questions/Ideas

- intro scene
- backup boss fight? or how does persuasion give an advantage

## Getting There
#### Intro Scene

The party has been told that elite warriors will be needed if the mundane world is to hold its own against the oncoming invasion. There are others across the continent, but they are here, now.

We do not know the strength of the enemy. Other inhabitants of the continent have fallen, but that is because they were weak and complacent. We need information, allies, and always more power. I believe you can get us started on that path.

In the Crystal Caves, there is a rift in the planes. Some drow have come through there, but we have been stronger. But we cannot wait for them to conquer the continent, take all its resources and bring us to heel. So we must venture into their lands to take *their* resources; then we may yet have hope.

Our prisoners have spoken of an alabaster tower on the other side of the rift, run by one of those eye-freaks they have down there. It seems the drow and illithid are conspiring against our world, but the eye-freaks aren't fans of the brain-eaters. So perhaps there is an opportunity here. But the eye-freaks are also unappealing allies. So if we just eliminate the risk where they all join forces against us, our odds improve regardless.

alright we use the book
>Vorâ€™pat in the war room (area X3), and the lower-tower guards each wear a psionic flying amulet that gives them a flying speed equal to their walking speed while within the tower. A creature who wears one of these amulets gains the same benefit

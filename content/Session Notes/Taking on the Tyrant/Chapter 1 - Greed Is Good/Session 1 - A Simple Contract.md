1342 Autumn 68
## Session Description

Our party starts their adventure in the small fishing village of [[Holburg]]. After picking up a contract from the mayor, [[Fibblestib Waggletop]] to find his uncle [[Eldar Berevan]], the party explores the village to figure out where he went. After some investigation, they save him from a group of Sahuagin (known locally as "sea devils") attempting to perform some sort of perverse ritual and safely return him home.

 1342 Autumn 72
## Session Description

After striking a deal with [[Reagan Filigree|Chief]], the party heads to the [[Sefport Guild Hall]] to investigate [[Elstan Siannodel]] and the [[Inspectors]]. Then, they have to figure out how they want to deal with the consequences of what they've learned.

## Recap

> When last we left our heroes, they had managed to procure some maps of the sewers through the most legitimate means available. With an exceptional display of dwarven stonecunning from Scan, the party found their way to Bramble's Barrow without incident. Then, boldly brandishing their weapons, they engaged in tense negotiation with the Chief of the Tunnel Snakes and struck a tentative deal. The Snakes would offer a foot in the door toward influencing the politics of the continent; a small sum of gold, for damages; and some peace and quiet for themselves and other mercenary groups taking contracts on behalf of the Capital Council. In exchange, the Snakes would get some peace and quiet of their own... and some information about the man in charge of the Inspectors of Sefport: Elstan Siannodel.

## Building a Foundation

#### A Message for Talia

On the walk back to the [[Dealer's Choice]], the party is interrupted by an exasperated halfling named Barlan Copperace, working on behalf of [[Capital Mail]]. He comes bearing a letter from [[Malphar Demacras]] inviting Talia to the [[Fair of a Thousand Dreams]]. Barlan says that Capital Mail can reply with an RSVP, either "yes" or "no". He then will leave the party on their way.

#### Stopping By Steel

In [[Session 3 - Ettin Ready]], the party ran into [[Theodore Kensington]], brother to the head of [[Steel]]. He offered them the opportunity to ingratiate themselves with the guild by performing work on their behalf.

If the party decides to pursue these leads further, they would once again find themselves at the [[Sefport Guild Hall]]. They could fruitlessly wander the halls of Steel and explore a bit, though they might find themselves on the wrong side of the building's security. However, if were to go to the information booth, [[Pip Halligan]] could identify who they might want to talk to. In this case, it would be [[Theodore Kensington]] himself, though his actual power within the guild is less than he might like.

When the party walks into the room, they find Theodore in a massive chair befitting of his frame, snoring loudly. When they inevitably awaken him, he'll start awake and bluster out a deal. Of course, the deal is for food - he wants something "sufficiently exotic", and he'll leave it up to the party to determine what that means. "You guys go out in the wilderness, right? I'm sure you can find something exciting." If they can provide such a delicacy, then he'll talk with [[Peter Kensington]] and make sure that they can buy the highest-quality weapons from [[Steel]] and their partners.
## Investigating the Investigators

#### Back to the Alley

When the party left [[Bramble's Barrow]] and finished their negotiations with [[Reagan Filigree|Chief]], they were told to meet with a contact at the [[Dark Alley]].

>With no need for subtlety this time around, your party enters the Dark Alley all together. As the name suggests, this dingy bar is much darker than the bright daylight just outside. So it takes a second for your eyes to adjust and start to make out the people and furniture of the establishment. It takes *less* than a second after you walk through the door for your ears to be assaulted by an immediate outburst: "Oh, you have GOT to be FUCKING kidding me!"
>
>You've heard that voice before. You scan the room, processing as the scattered shapes in the room form into familiar tables, chairs, and people. And there, sitting at the nearest table to the door, is Wasp - everyone's favorite roadside woodcarver.
> 
>"This is a joke!" she exclaims. "Of course it's you people. I bet she thinks she's real fuckin funny." She sighs. "Alright, take your chance to gloat. Then let's get down to business."

In a conversation where she is still very much not happy to be there, Wasp can share the following information with the party:
- The party will have an appointment scheduled at Elstan's office for noon tomorrow and should be able to just walk in like they belong.
- Elstan will be out from about 11:30-1:30.
- Their goal is to figure out what he's up to without getting caught.
- If they can try to make sure everything ends up where it started, that would be ideal. He's going to know that the Snakes are responsible for this diversion, so evidence that things have been disturbed would show their hand. However, the *most* important thing is gathering information.
#### Snooping Around

When the time comes, the party will head to the [[Sefport Guild Hall]] and to the wing of the [[Inspectors]] to "meet" with [[Elstan Siannodel]]. The clerk Diesa will be in the front desk area, searching through boxes of documents, tidying up bookshelves, and otherwise running about breathlessly. She doesn't seem to notice the players as they come in. The room looks the same as the last time they came in - it's a little reception area with a desk embedded into the wall like a movie ticket booth. On the side, there's a little chest-height saloon door that leads past the desk and into the offices.

After they get Diesa's attention, she leads them through the hallways of the office and drops them off at Elstan's door. She wishes them luck and heads back to her post. Ghorza's office is just next door. The door has a window on it, with open blinds, and there are two large windows at the back of the room, also each with large blinds.

The room contains a couple filing cabinets, a desk, a couch, and some well-populated bookshelves. One drawer on the desk is locked, and if they shake the drawer or try to force it open, they will hear the sound of glass rolling around inside.

## Following Through

#### Breaking the News

As requested, the party heads back through the sewers to [[Bramble's Barrow]] to meet with [[Reagan Filigree|Chief]] and debrief her on what they've learned from their investigation.

When they arrive in the hideout, Gov greets them from his desk. They hear Chief shouting from the left path, and Gov half-heartedly suggests that they wait until she's ready to meet with them.

If the party investigates further, they find Chief shouting at a middle-aged elf in a makeshift cell. She is pleading and arguing with him about working with her to fix this godforsaken town.

>Hearing the shouting from down the corridor, you decide to head closer to see what the commotion is about. There are probably a dozen folks in here, and they seem unperturbed by this exchange. 

When the party negotiated with Chief previously, they requested assistance in starting to develop the political power required to make things happen at the scale required to assemble an army and fight back against the [[Black Hand]]. It has only been a day, but she has been able to call in a favor with a local noble and get the party an invitation to meet with the old second-in-command of the Silver Blade, [[Salvador Hernandez]]. Perhaps they can leverage their connection to construct this army that they seek.
#### Goodbye, Ghorza

If [[Ghorza Jaekel]] discovered the party during their investigation, [[Latimer]] will have learned about the Snakes' deception and the players' involvement. He will not be happy about Ghorza's insubordination and may lose his temper. It's possible that she will die - if that happens, he will likely seek to frame somebody (the party? [[Reagan Filigree|Chief]]?) for the action, making a public display of it.
#### The Devil's Work

When cornered, [[Latimer]] will pull out two magical spheres, each about the size of a baseball and glowing with a warm flame within. He will make some comment about how he has to go and smash the spheres on the ground, summoning a Bearded Devil and two Hell Hounds. Have fun!

## Notes

- Party leaves the sewers - think "hmm, folks in the Dark Alley might not know that we're chill, let's go out the way we came."
- Talia wanted a diversion to head to a potion shop and pick up some healing potions. I figured they should have more than just healing potions but D&D's potions are pretty lacking and I like the idea that high-tier magic items have restricted access. So I made a little "random potion machine" that the players could pull from if they want - not familiar enough to make gacha mechanics, but that would be thematically consistent with the guilds.
- Party is very suspicious of Elstan and the Inspectors as a whole. Is he part of the mongi?
- Scan thinks they'll just do this job and get out. Etar is less convinced.
- Party has an appointment with Elstan, spooks themselves out of the plan because they're scared of what will happen if Ghorza sees them.
- Party considers having one or two people get Ghorza out of the office. Best option seems to be one of Etar or Temple asking her out to lunch. After a lot of waffling, Talia's like "guys what if we just went for it and trusted that we can talk our way out of it if we have to?". So they go in and everything's fine.
- Investigation went mostly as expected - Talia did some investigation checks on the filing cabinets and found the appropriate documents. Scan (?) immediately pulls up the rug and looks in the couch cushions. But they don't have a good way to get into the locked door.
- Scan prepared Silence today, so they could try to open the drawer. First, considered woodcarver's tools, but I said "i don't think you can really 'cut out' the lock with how drawer locks work?"
- Etar tries to gently open the drawer a couple times, then absolutely obliterates the mechanism. Potion spills over the letter, but they can still make it out. They have their smoking gun, but their intrusion will be obvious and attributable to them.
- Etar is appalled that the Snakes have apparently kidnapped people? I can live with murder, but kidnapping? That's where I draw the line.
- They want to cover it up and decide to bring Ghorza in the loop. She doesn't like the idea of dealing with the Snakes, but she doesn't have much of a choice. She'll do what she can and see if she can connect with people to disrupt this plot to invade Sefport.
- The party hustles down to Bramble's Barrow through the Dark Alley and gives Chief the bad news. She's not super receptive, as she really would love to see the guilds crumble. When she finds her own file, though, that's sufficient evidence that this is bad news for her as well.
- Chief brings the party over to Elstan in his cage and breaks the news. She explains what she knows about the shapeshifter and asks if they've looped anyone in, explaining the basic mind-reading powers that it has. Realizing the situation, the party rushes back to the Guild Hall to make a plan with Ghorza and make sure she's alright.
- After some planning from out behind the Guild Hall, Talia gets boosted over the fence so she can cover the window and the rest of the folks go through the front door. After some brief difficulty with Diesa, Scan casts Silence and they kick down the door...

## Reflections

- Still no combat, and both Grant and Dav expressed a preference for more combat.
	- Some of this has to do with optionality, some with pacing and tardiness.
	- Can design next arc to be more conventional - heading outside the city, through the wilderness to get to where they need to go.
- Party foresaw a lot more obstacles to what they wanted than I did.
	- Lead to a lot of planning that wasn't necessarily aligned with how I had thought about things
	- Occasionally, obstacles popped up that I didn't really intend - like Diesa when they went back in to get whatever they left in Elstan's office.
	- Wasn't a big problem and led to discussions of Etar asking out Ghorza so it works
- Investigation scene went pretty well.
	- Battle map helped set the stage and make things more concrete
	- Emphasizing the limited time throughout and making skill checks take a certain amount of time worked pretty well
	- Didn't see Silence coming nor account for its duration. Adapting to say "you can have one last shot to jam it open" felt pretty fair and worked basically perfectly.
	- Would have been useful to be prepared going in about consequences of soaking the letter. Kind figured it wouldn't happen.
- Documents seemed fun but were apparently less clear than I thought
	- Only Noah seemed to really read through *everything* and try to put it together, and he did so reasonably effectively
	- Party needed the smoking gun to put it together and selectively ignored evidence that did not fit their hypothesis - why would Elstan sign with "L"?
- Party continues to be stymied by NPCs who want things and are consistent with what they want instead of bending to the party's whims.
- Loving using Obsidian for notes. Makes me feel so much more comfortable in knowing what's going on and being able to pull things up when I need them. Looking forward to prepping new city, adventure, etc.

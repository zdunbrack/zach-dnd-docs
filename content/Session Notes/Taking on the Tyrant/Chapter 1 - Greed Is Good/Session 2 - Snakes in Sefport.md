## Content

lead-in: eldar catches them as they're heading out of the inn, takes them by his cottage for a quick chat and some rewards  
assumption: folks travel on the road toward sefport
 
encounter 1: one lady (swashbuckler) on the road, three crossbowmen on the hill above. guy on the road is much stronger than the others and needs to actually survive a couple rounds.  
perception opportunity to notice the ambush beforehand - will also give details they can see about the person from a distance. whittling is his cover but he's terrible at it. dressed in studded leather, hidden snake tattoo at his collar.
 
road is peaceful the rest of the way. enter sefport and it's a polarized town - a clear merchant class and clear underbelly. not a safe place to be, though - there's a clear guard presence to try to maintain order in places. blue shirts are stationed across the main area of town and the docks, but spread to the point where they're clearly not on top of everything.
 
federal building: lazy mfer with squidward voice, pretentious and waste's party's time. also a gnome, named **Abalaba Nopenstallen**. she tries to ignore/put off heroes, eventually will ring a bell and pass the note onto some human worker from the back who will go do the actual work and give the party their money.
 
6'6" orc in oversized trenchcoat tries to catch attention of party (when they turn in job? but if not, another time), named **Ghorza Jaekel**. says she wants to catch the party on the edge of town that night, by the cemetery. only has a couple minutes, promises more will be explained later.
 
Should be mid-afternoon at this point, so the party has some time to explore and figure out what they want to do. Can wander around town, shop, talk to folks at an inn. could scope out the cemetery, check out the local churches, lots of options (for which I will improvise.. poorly).
 
cemetery encounter: there's a local gang called the tunnel snakes who are giving the inspectors lots of trouble. ghorza has always been disgusted by the corruption and made it her mission to hunt them down, and briefly had leadership's backing before having it rescinded under the excuse of pragmatism and safety. ghorza doesn't really care and wants to hunt down anyway, so is enlisting the help of adventurers. has been trying for a couple weeks, but only snakes have been turning in contracts and she knows better.
 
what does she know?

- hideout is in bramble's barrow to the south. there's a natural cave system that they've moved into - but rumors are that the entrance is well-guarded and the wildlife in the surrounding area is dangerous. might be able to catch the jump on them if you actually went in the front door? since they expect that to be well-guarded.
- snakes don't head thru the wilderness to get to the hideout. so there must be a secret way in - they're not called the tunnel snakes for nothing. probably not as simple as finding it and walking in; expect some kind of security. you'll need some inside information to infiltrate. well, that or violence and a good plan.
- there's some cooperation between ex-members of the silver blade and the snakesâ€¦ arrangement unclear. members of the blade are _very_ capable, though, so probably best to avoid scrapping with them if you can.
- taking credit for the government contracts is one of the more profitable endeavors they have, so they send their best to take care of it. aware of a contract taken by a group to the west, may be able to intercept them to gather information and deal the snakes another substantial blow outside of the safety of sefport.
- there's definitely plenty of folks who don't like the snakes, but they may not be easy to find. they have something of a sinister stranglehold on the city.

1342 Autumn 70
## Session Description

Our party completes a contract to kill an ettin in hopes of capturing a member of the [[Tunnel Snakes]] to interrogate them on information about how to get to [[Bramble's Barrow]]. Expecting to be ambushed on their journey back to [[Sefport]], they are instead surprised when the bandits show up right after their battle with the ettin is completed.

## Notes

- expected party to just look for sewer map, go to the guild hall, and go forward with their plan
- instead:
	- they focused on inspectors, wanted to enlist ghorza's help in clearing out the bar (wasn't gonna happen for a number of reasons, hope it didn't come across as shutting down their idea)
	- tried to scope out the dark alley with a couple folks. prolonged roleplay scene with noah, a little bit of grant and tiny bit of anna.
		- decided not to have wasp there, since that would likely force something with how conspicuous noah was. would have been interesting but not what I wanted nor what the players wanted I think
		- came up with NPC names on the fly, delayed a little but worked well enough
		- not a waste of time
			- grant ordering leaf-lover's special was funny, easy to roll with, and actually genuinely positive in terms of making my life easier.
			- got to learn more about the silver blades and how they'd relate to the snakes
			- had a backup plan for if they were unable to make the sewer map thing work
		- I think I set the vibe well enough, establishing that folks were skittish of outsiders regardless of whether or not they knew who they were. here, noah was just "some dwarf from the mountains"
- then they got back on track as I expected - went to the guild hall, met with pip and got directed to coast and the correct bureaucrat
	- talia being a wallflower with cloak meant kid didn't get a chance to be excited about bug-arm. disappointing. but he did yearn for the mines, getting excited about etar instead
	- party was frustrated by interaction with thervan, just being slimy and extracting money. ultimately negotiated down to operating costs after mentioning the snakes, at the request to kill all of them.
		- didn't kill all of them; could come back later. we'll see.
	- gave party some agency in thinking about skills and what they could use. grant rolled okay, dav argued for stonecunning and I said "later", got a second okay result for some other skill. meant "dc was on the easy side, we'll see"
	- noah wanted to check out steel, but even that group is like coast. vibe in my head was like getting lost in the pediatrician's office back hallways ("where the hell is reception")
		- expectation of the organization is that you're coming in knowing you're talking to someone, or else pip can help you out (but probably still need a connection)
		- more offices than shops - shops will be out and about.
		- had meant to prepare more for what could be here but hadn't - somewhat convenient that it loosely shut things down, but would have wanted to improvise if they talked to pip.
- gave context on smuggling routes and easy entry point. not tons of entries to the sewers, largely handwaved to start. dav rolling 19+4+2+2 (guidance, stonecunning) meant I was able to say "okay yeah uh you get there"
	- also convenient for pacing - things went a lot slower than I expected and anna showed up late even for her, so I was kinda hoping to be able to just get them to the hideout.
- arriving in the hideout: used the new tiles, pretty nice. do need to pick up dry erase stuff
	- came in cocky, weapons brandished. gov called them the flyswatters, party didn't understand. wasn't thrilled with the name but not important.
	- folks went down the ladder and negotiated and then things got interesting.
		- party had one good answer to the question "what do you want?": how about we take your men and make an army of it
		- problem: the answer to that was no. she was willing to offer a lot of things, but her men aren't soldiers, and they wouldn't follow such a call.
		- party inquired a bit as to chief's motivations and background, and she shared bits and pieces - but was more interested in promptly resolving the armed men in her hideout.
		- lots of chaos and turmoil around "okay wait what do we want ???" after the answer of "no"â€¦ are we choosing violence? are we really working with these thugs? they tried to kill us
			- glorious
			- did get to see dav figure out his character a bit and it was interesting
	- ultimately: took on the task of figuring out what was going on with elstan. awkward tension because chief wants to share some information but hide the fact that elstan is in her hideout. should be interesting payoff

## Reflections
- grant participated infrequently but retained characterization throughout. seemed content with it
- keep ending up in situations where it's me and noah going back and forth while everyone else hangs out. has usually worked for me?
	- this one worked well in terms of giving broader information, even if it didn't necessarily advance their immediate plans
- anna's character is still very undefined, surprising nobody.
- dav made good strides in defining scan
- no combats this session, but could have had a couple! dark alley, sewers, or hideout all could have become violent.
- still got to roll some dice because of how I handled the stuff with the maps, and social encounters also had a good chunk of dice-rolling
- overall, session was much more focused on character and player than mechanics and rolling. and I think that's fine. last session was combat-heavy.
- may want to target a combat for next session? level four now!
	- maybe wasp is in the alley and isn't too fond of them.. calm emotions could stop things before they begin. and that would be fine.
	- could bring out the bartender having poison/sedatives

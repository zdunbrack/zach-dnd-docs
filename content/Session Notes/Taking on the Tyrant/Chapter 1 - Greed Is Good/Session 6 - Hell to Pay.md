1342 Autumn 73-75
## Session Description

The party gets their first taste of blood in a while as they confront the agent of the  trying to facilitate the invasion of [[Sefport]]. Then, they depart for [[Laskar]] to meet with an old commander from the [[Silver Blade]] and foil the Black Hand's plans there.
## Recap

>When last we left our heroes, they had uncovered a conspiracy by the Black Hand to invade Sefport under the guise of a trade agreement. Deftly navigating between the Inspectors and the Tunnel Snakes, the party discovered that the head of the Inspectors was actually a shapeshifter, with the real Elstan sitting in a cell with the Snakes. After Chief revealed that the shapeshifter could read thoughts and therefore would learn what happened from Ghorza, they realized that the jig was up and rushed back to the [[Sefport Guild Hall]] deal with this threat once and for all.

## Taking Care of Business

#### Brawl at the Guild Hall

The party bursts into Ghorza's office with the help of a Silence spell, trying to avoid alerting the Inspectors as to what is happening. They see an armored devil holding her up by the neck, pinning her against the wall. He looks at the door just as it bursts open, and we roll initiative!

Cambion's priorities: summon, cause trouble, get the hell out of there
Summons don't act until following round, seem to mostly be focused on causing chaos.
Ghorza tries to get the fuck out and raise the alarm, can bring in a couple generic guards.

On turn 2, Cambion casts plane shift and gets the hell out of there, probably with some parting words.

>"Very rude of you to meddle here and interrupt my plans. Perhaps this little rathole will not yet find its fate, but in time, this entire continent will be one under the Black Hand. Such is our arrangement. Now, if you'll forgive me, I have business to attend to elsewhere. I recommend *against* interfering again. Further meddling will induce... consequences. May I never see you again.

#### Wrapping Up

After the fight is over, things are a mess. Stuff is on fire, there are probably some charred corpses sitting around, and Ghorza is trying to process what the fuck just happened. 

Is the party going to stick around to help out? Are they heading to make contact with the Snakes? Are they going to take the rest of the evening easy and rest before heading out? Got some loose ends to tie up, hopefully can give closure.

[[Elstan Siannodel]] should find the party and have a private conversation with them. He'll deliver them a gift from [[Reagan Filigree]] as thanks for likely saving her life (Charm of the Waves?) and give his own gratitude. He'll probably inquire a bit about what happened to bring them here and what's next for each of them. Hopefully this gives the party a little bit of roleplay opportunity and I can push folks for a little deeper characterization. We'll see.
## Hitting the Road

#### A Gnoll New World

>You head west from Sefport along the main road, finally moving on toward bigger and better things. It's a familiar path, as you all came this way before you picked up that first contract to find an old elf who disappeared from a small fishing village. That all seems quaint now, after this last week of violence, confusion, and tense negotiations. Oh, and the devils. That was something, too.
>
>Unlike the last time you went this way, you aren't as worried about keeping an eye out for ambush locations after making your deal with the Tunnel Snakes. So you travel a bit faster, making it past the bridge where some gnolls and a very real two-headed giant were extorting passersby to feed their insatiable hunger.
>
>Even with Winter just around the corner, the weather is fairly pleasant. It's chilly, but skies are clear and there's not much wind, so whatever robes and furs you have on are more than enough to keep you warm as you walk. Every once in a while, you think you hear something shuffling in the trees... but nothing happens, so you keep walking. Probably a bear or something.
>
>After a full day of solid travel, you make it to a small inn at Miller's Junction. Here's where the road splits. North, to the mountains and the capital; and southwest, toward the Great Plain, and eventually, your destination. Your feet are tired, and it's nice to just get back to a warm bed and a proper meal.

Is there any small talk or anything that the party wants to make with whatever folks happen to be in the inn? It's a small place with the innkeep and a handful of travelers. Improvise details and lore if so.

>When morning comes, you find your way back on the road. Travel today is similarly peaceful and pleasant.

Are you guys like chatting as you go? About anything in particular? Questioning Talia about family, city, etc. ? Don't have to talk it out, just curious.

>It's probably late afternoon and you guys are just bumping along as described when you think you hear something up ahead.

get perception checks from everyone

>It's faint now, but you hear something from a bit ahead up the road. Sounds like... howling. Laughter? Wailing? You're not exactly sure.

eventually, they'll hear a scream.

competing objectives? protecting the people vs. dealing with the archers

4 gnoll abyssal archers to start, arrows whizzing by
4 gnoll marauders start far off, need to dash into range
1 gnoll cackler to start... second might come in late if the first just gets bopped.

more gnolls, then silver blades come in? cocky, looking for a fight

silver blades are a couple of humans, ~35yo - they're having fun in combat! should be bantering
names: clinton (deep, flirtatious, smug, punny) and audrey cross (wears the pants, slightly upshifted, kelli-adjacent vowels)

## Additional Prep

#### Review any notes from the previous Session.
- Any loose ends that need to get wrapped up?
	- Currently in combat, but will need to resolve what happens with the [[Tunnel Snakes]], [[Inspectors]], guilds, and [[Black Hand]]
- Did the players tell you any of their goals or hopes for the coming session?
	- Get out of [[Sefport]]
#### Review the PCs.
- What are they trying to do?
	- Great question. Broadly: Assemble a force to take on the [[Black Hand]]. Some desire for it to be the [[Silver Blade]].
	- Talia is also here.
- What do they want? 
	- Another grea[[Black Hand]]ia's parents once we get to Laskar. 
- What do the players of these characters enjoy at the table?
	- Another great question. Supposedly, both RP and combat, but Anna doesn't really engage too much with combat and I find it difficult to really believe in any of the characters.
- Can I highlight one or more of them in the session?
	- Expecting today to be very combat-oriented, so Etar will likely have a chance to shine. Talia can do something unique with the gnoll archers as well.
- **How can I give them interesting decisions?**
	- 
#### Review or Create NPCs.
**Review:**
- Which NPCs are relevant to this session?
	- Sefport folks (well enough defined), peasants, blades
- What are their goals (in reference to their personal desires or fears)?
- How have they made progress towards their goals?
- How do they plan on making progress towards their goals?

## Notes

- Basically just the opening combat in terms of happenings of substance. Started late as often, ended early because pacing would have made starting another combat at the end (with Anna, who often fades late) feel pretty ambitious.
- Combat started with Talia shooting a dart through the window and it bouncing off the cambion before he summoned the minions to bring some life into the combat.
- Etar blinded one of the hellhounds, which Talia then critted as a result for more than half its health. Talia was putting in work.
- Etar couldn't get big because of small room, so he couldn't use the giant club. That meant no magical weapon, so bearded devil had resistance.
- Cambion wanted to leave, but wanted to lecture the heroes before he did. But the Silence spell blocked sound and Talia decided to run inside the range at the last minute, so he tried to disrupt the spell and hung around until he could deliver his threat.
- Abjure Enemy was cool, where Temple held the cambion in place. Visualized as chains emerging from the air. He still could totally have cast Plane Shift, but it was a nice thought.
- After combat: Ghorza tries to get some info out of the party to understand what the hell happened. Party "group huddles" outside the now-broken window, then leaves via outside. Ghorza's disappointed.
- Party heads to the Snakes to see if they can find Elstan, but he's been released and is already on his way. Chief thanks the party for saving her life and the town and sends them back. Party laments how many times they've made this trek.
- Talia gets Charm of the Waves from Elstan (gift from Chief), party revels a bit at the [[Dark Alley]] before heading back to the [[Dealer's Choice]] and resting. They get an affidavit from Elstan and the Court saying "yep this is a big deal", with instructions that the [[Sunguard]] are the folks that they want to talk to.

## Reflections

- Giving the heroes a full round before the summons acted was generous, but felt like a good call given the potential lethality of hellhounds' fire breath.
- Combat is fun! Transparency about enemies' abilities is a double-edged sword, think it led to more discussion, though. Not sure how I want to handle it.
- Session pacing is difficult when I don't know how long a session is going to be. Anna's inconsistency both in time of showing up and engagement when she does is very hard to work around.
- Visual theming for folks is still difficult - Talia has bugs, and I think that visuals in combat are positive. Maybe should ask players for opinions and for an aesthetic for their character. Grant has bugs, Noah has fire/tattoos, Dav has ??, and I've invented something of a red hot fury for Anna but would appreciate something from her directly. Red hot does work with her hair, though.
- As expected, I've still got nothing when it comes to improvised descriptions, at least outside of combat. Hard to tell to what extent my players not giving me anything back makes that harder though. Noah gives me visuals and happenings to work with, which I really appreciate.
- When I mentioned the little wiki website during session, Anna looked into it and engaged with it to figure out what made sense for her small village. I appreciated the engagement, though having focus on what was happening would have been cool.

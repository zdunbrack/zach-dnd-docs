1342 Winter 11 (midday) - 1342 Winter 15 (evening)
## Session Description

After showing some hobgoblins who's boss, the party continues on to Wandermere and discovers a way to salvage the captain's platemail. They also connect with some old friends along the way.
## Recap

>When last we left our heroes, they picked up some supplies before heading out of Laskar and onto the road toward the mountains. Friti was still sour after the party considered leaving him behind, but his focus turned to adventure once they got out of the city. As they started to travel, Talia caught glimpses of a figure watching their travels from just off the path, but lost track of them after the first day. But a couple days later, smoke trails marked the sky and pursued the party along the road, searching for them and getting surprised by the party's stealth. After a dangerous and complicated back-and-forth, the hobgoblins all lay dead on the ground - but not before giving a good beating to Etar and Temple on the way.
## Questions

- what happens in wandermere?
	- clinton calls audrey and says the amateurs are back
	- they don't recognize friti, will ask the party about him. friti tries to earn some respect. the blades like him.
- what's traveling through the mountains like in winter?
	- they bought furs - should be relevant
	- cold tries to induce exhaustion as they travel, but furs keep them in appropriate condition. constitution checks, adv from furs? dc10 probably
	- also there's an ice troll
- what rewards are available from last combat?
	- platemail (damaged)
	- blazing crossbow (heavy crossbow, sets creatures on fire for 1d6dmg/turn. can be put out by action from self or another creature.)
	- collective 20gp
- mini sticky notes for status conditions
- where is friti at?
	- unhappy with scan *and* etar (different reasons)
		- scan: how come you treat me so harshly and etar (who does nonsense) better?
		- etar: how can i prove to you that i'm worth it?
	- pretentious kid still, stuck-up and cocky
- scan gets message about talia?
- how did scan ask friti to put him out?

scenes:
- dealing with aftermath of hobgoblins (how do they search? have a little scene. how are they carrying a full extra set of platemail?)
- arriving in wandermere
- interactions with cross? gob the vast?
	- gob the vast has sobered up, taken on work for the inn to pay off his substantial tab
- platemail repair sidequest (potion sidequest still there? maybe they just require a special potion for resizing gear. that'd be quirky)
- shortstack in old cross, with info (sefport? any rumors from the mountains?)
	- what is unique about old cross?
	- magic apprentice from college?
- have some idea of mountain wilderness encounter, what's going on in giatto
## Wandermere

#### Crossing Paths

prompt: cross folks go to take team to potion shop, except things have gone a little awry

cottage vibes, cozy and well-decorated. but also oops all jelly

room 1: display room. cauldron in center of room, sentient ooze in back (overcooked healing potion).s
room 2: kitchen. some dried herbs, nice smell buried underneath burnt jelly. flying potion turned jelly flying around, key inside

room 3: basement, frozen over. icy floor, ice ooze(s)

room 4: top floor, two bedrooms and a library. 
either: black slime covering all of the nice decor. movement from the hallway.. potion of dragon's majesty
or: rainbow ooze everywhere, 

or both!

## Notes

- Open session on the battlefield after the hobgoblins. Noah reminded me that the hobgoblins are like Runescape demons and leave ashes rather than corpses. Players were able to loot 40gp, blazing crossbow, and damaged hobgoblin platemail from the battle.
- Short rest and some roleplay. Was intending to have Friti talk with Scan here, but things ended up out in the open such that there wasn't space for that.
	- Grant opened up a conversation about why they thought the hobgoblins were after them. Some discussion about the enemies they've acquired and the hobgoblins' attempt on Salvador's life.
- Party makes it to Wandermere! Heads straight to inn, doesn't initially seek out the Cross family for any reason.
- Gob now working for the inn worked well enough, party believed him paying off his tab. Etar took his chair, of course.
- Some casual intra-party roleplay in this time, I think? Don't really remember. Friti asked about what happened last time they were here and got the run-down (and some cat ears).
- Talia decides she's taking Temple to the Cross family's place to talk about the Blades, since she knows that that's something Temple cares about (even if she's too shy to make a scene of it).
	- Entertaining scene with the Cross family - Talia asks some questions about the Blade, Temple shyly tries to pretend it's not about her, Etar presses who Talia's asking for, and Temple gets outed.
	- Of course Audrey was following the whole way and Clinton was clueless.
	- Party inquires a bit about hobgoblins and gets some context: they have a den, and the Blade's approach is to wipe 'em out. That'll solve your problem.
	- Gets directions to Billy the Blacksmith for repairing the platemail.
- Friti doesn't really understand the context and elects to stay behind with Scan instead.. especially since he has something to say.
	- Talks about how he really didn't (doesn't) appreciate being chastised for having emotions when 
	- Scan says that it's about the anger being misdirected at Talia, to which Friti comes back with: "yeah, because she's the only one of you guys who I had the *delusion* of thinking was worth trusting". Got something of a reaction from the table.
	- Scan didn't really give much reaction, so Friti said his piece and headed up to bed.
- Quick debrief between party before folks head to bed. Friti is more comfortable now and has a proper bed.
- Minor scene with Talia pressing Etar on his drinking in the morning. Didn't really amount to much, but Noah seemed to be pleased that it happened.
- Temple and Scan head to Billy the Blacksmith, get their options:
	- 40gp, help with potion/oil supplier 1h west of town
	- 100gp (50 now, 50 later), take about an ide to get the work done.
	- 300gp, use existing oil supplies to repair the armor.
- Party decides to leave the armor behind and continue onward toward Old Cross. Tells the Cross family about the blacksmith's request and uses Sending to learn the details over the next day or couple. Gets sufficient details about the oozes and how it worked out.
- Session ends with the party making it to Old Cross, and discovering that their bartender is a certain halfling thief they've encountered before and let go.
## Reflections

- Coming in with lower expectations and investment meant I had an easier time with all of it, but also that I had less high highs than I have when preparing big things.
- Having five-room dungeon, platemail tradeoffs prepped was helpful.
- Giving Dav(/Anna) the tradeoffs as narration rather than RP felt like the right move, and I was validated in that with how it played out.
- Coming in with 1-2 scenes that Friti will force to happen seems to be a good idea.
- Progress feels slower without forced plot development or combat. Playing the game is fine, and slowing things down a bit can be nice as a change of pace. But I'm ready to have things hit again.

##### things to keep track of
- underdark people refer to players as Overlanders
- [[Septenary Order]] is setting up to blackmail [[Scan Oakburn]] and gain possession of the Eye. If they can get it without coercion, that's a bonus.
	- need to remember what Scan told the church.
	- scan gets a message from the church about Talia
	- if the Church gets possession of the Eye, they are able to (after some downtime?) enable cross-planar travel.
		- the Eye can transport up to seven people back, based on area. triggers one minute after activation.
		- orders: retrieve the elf and the researcher. kill the rest. it's a mercy and a necessary task.
	- the church are watching
- deep dwarves use minecarts like roller coasters to travel around quickly between outposts

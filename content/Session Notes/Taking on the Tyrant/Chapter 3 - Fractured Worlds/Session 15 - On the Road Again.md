1342 Winter 8 (afternoon) - 1342 Winter 11 (midday)
## Session Description

Standing just outside the gates of the Nenzune estate after Etar induced a rude exit, Friti and the party need to make some final preparations and hit the road. Who knows what they'll find on their way toward the Kharesti Mountains?
## Recap

>When last we left our heroes, they picked up [[Friti Hernandez|Friti]] and planned to sneak into the Archives of the [[Mage's College]] to learn more about [[Phineas Azarel]]'s expedition for the [[Eye of Etheril]]. Using Azarel's Pocket Sphere as cover, Scan was able to get into the Archives and read through documents describing a journey into the Deep - including a rough map of what the College expected to find on the other side of the Battletop Gate. He recorded what he could and brought the information to the party, where they then discussed next steps. Finally, they sat down with both Friti and [[Salvador Hernandez]] to discuss whether Salvador would let Friti accompany them.. an exchange which ended in Etar being unkindly escorted off the premises after he moved to attack Salvador to make a point about Friti's ability to function under pressure.
## Questions

Salvador gives friti the gem
foreshadow hobgoblins on the horizon (ask about travel style. perception check?)
rumors about [[Sefport]]?
scan gets a message from the church about Talia

#### Friti's First Night

- i'm not letting talia out of my sight
- sleeps in front of door, casts *alarm* on window
- still has a major issue with talia for being complicit. 
- annoyed at etar too, will confront at some point.
- doesn't really care about temple or scan. they're boring squares.

## After That

#### Hobbies and Gobbies

combat 2! hobgoblins.. catch up to heroes? they march harder, work harder, rest less. 

#### Old Cross

don't expect to get here, but [[Shortstack]] is bartending in the local inn. Maybe shares more details of rumors of Sefport.

ex-Blades came in and dealt with the ogre camp. remnants of it outside of town, burned. bodies aren't around, but camp is. said it's "left as a record"
## Notes

- Small debrief about what the hell Etar did. Not really addressed in any substantial way, but there was *a* moment.
- Friti was mostly hanging back and letting the adults talk. Was bitter and did have that come across. Grant called out that I (apparently) emphasized that already last time, which I didn't remember. But it also felt reasonably appropriate for Friti to stick to it.
- Tactical discussions about gearing up for the road. Reasonable amounts of consideration about the options, magical and otherwise. Ended up with *mending* wand and a bunch of nonmagical items.
- Scene with Friti in Talia and Temple's room where Friti didn't trust that they wouldn't try to leave him again. Lay in front of the door and cast *alarm* on the window. Talia thought it was some way of reflecting on his mother, but not quite.
- Talia noticed some eyes seemed to be on them during travel, but lost track of them after a few hours. No complications in Rochdale - picked up furs for trudging through the mountains in winter - but caught wind of smoke trails behind them as they continued. Ended up getting off the path as the smoke trails caught up to them, turning into hobgoblins and searching for them...
- Party got the drop on them! Long combat, reasonably tense, but Scan, Talia, and Friti stayed conscious the whole time from the back lines and were able to do enough (including getting Etar and Temple back up via Healing Word) to close it out.

## Reflections

- narrative description in combat would be a better experience, but I can't tell how much any of my players care about it - either abstractly or with my specific implementation of it.
- can still push to speed up combat, did once and didn't really continue. push noah to use multiple dice still probably, or else **fill up that downtime with narration**
- understated descriptions/characters are a mixed bag. I like when it leaves opportunity for discovery (like Dav with *alarm*), but often it just means players don't interact (like in the Snakes' hideout).

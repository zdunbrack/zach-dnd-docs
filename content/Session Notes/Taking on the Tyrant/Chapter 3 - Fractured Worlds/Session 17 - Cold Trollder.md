1342 Winter 15 (evening) - 1342 Winter 19 (night)
## Session Description

The party reunites with Shortstack and finally arrives in the Kharesti Mountains. After some trials on the road, they arrive in Giatto with the Battletop Gate looming just a half-day's travel ahead.
## Recap

>When last we left our heroes, they recovered from their encounter with the hobgoblins before moving onward to Wandermere. They discussed their options in town, reunited with some old friends, started the process of salvaging the hobgoblin captain's platemail, and spent some quality time together as a party. Once they had what they needed from Wandermere, they made the trek up to Old Cross, where they headed to the tavern and ran into a halfling thief whose life they'd spared in their second encounter with the Snakes.

## Questions/Ideas

- cowardly dwarf captured by ice trolls
	- loot?
	- what's his name/story?
- party has furs
- how is friti relevant here? what does he think/want?
	- wants to move onward
	- curious on shortstack's opinions since he's not a huge fan of most of the party
- what's the tone in giatto?

outline:
- shortstack and old cross
- trekking through the mountains
- frost trolls with captured dwarf (save the dwarf and kill the trolls? actually two objectives maybe for real this time)
	- they only speak giant, maybe should give noah some way of bypassing the encounter.. not going to be easy though.
- get to giatto? have presumably been told to be cautious, so they'll probably be cowards about it
## Chapter

#### Old Cross

- town vibes:
	- flyover town, mostly relevant for trade and travel
	- not as well-defended as sefport or laskar, but better fortifications than wandermere. 
	- business has slowed, more folks that are coming through are unruly and agitated
	- large town with few people.. maybe they'll come back. maybe they won't.
	- center of town has eight plinths with empty plaques on them
	- when ogres threatened the town, a lot of folks left.. no idea if they made it where they were going. probably toward [[Sefport]]
	- inn name: the Hasty Squirrel
		- run by Giso and Paige Vezaro (~50y/o humans)
- [[Shortstack]]:
	- real name: Rosnys Amberhand (Roz)
	- ![[Pasted image 20250628122448.png]]
	- scout statblock (shortsword, longbow, advantage on perception for hearing/sight)
	- been 20 days since party let her go, about an ide since she got here
	- snake tattoo around her neck
		- sylvaris helps those who help themselves.. so here I am, helping myself
	- shortstack knows some vibes about sefport
		- former blades who took on ogre job were definitely working with chief
		- is aware that elstan was freed but somewhat in name only
		- is comfortable in her current position, but still has commitment to the mission and may want to head back to sefport at some point
	- does know them as the flyswatters
- conversation topics:
	- shortstack being smug about feeling safe from threats to drag her face across the grave, feeling like she has the power to call these folks troublemakers and get em kicked out
	- who's the kid?
		- friti doesn't appreciate being called a kid
		- shortstack's like "bro i could take you in a round"
		- friti is irritated but curious at the history
	- how curious is the party to know what's happened with shortstack?
		- went the other direction, found her way to old cross.
	- how curious is the party about old cross?
	- how did you leave things in sefport?
	- where are you headed?

![[Pasted image 20250614145931.png]]

- function is basically just to add exhaustion before frost trolls, or else make the party choose to slow down (DC15 Con check, advantage due to furs)
- like a national park trail, with campsites every half-day of travel or so (inside little caves)
- **Furs reduce frequency, call it out narratively**
- probably would make sense to have some specific environmental challenge for them to overcome.. bridge is out? seems like a good challenge, probably some ice and snow around as well (25' across)
- trees are sparse!
#### Frost Trolls

- as they dive into a cave for the night, they hear voices from deeper within
- dwarf: Gand Greenhill (Scan knows a Lassnar Greenhill but not familiar with a Gand)
	- from inner Giatto
- what do they want?
	- to eat a dwarf.. he started it! he entered their cave.
	- they need something tasty..
	- hard to convince that they shouldn't just eat the party
- combat: nerf to one bite, one claw, 1d8 cold damage?
## Our Destination

#### Giatto

- rune of warmth upon entering the town
- party is noticed by some locals on the outskirts of town and brought into house. given a quick lay of the land
- house: Sigun (m) and Vellamo (f) Shatterfoot
- short rec: why are you here? go!
- context to explain:
	- warriors were killed or taken away (location ??)
	- 

#### The Battletop Mines

## Notes

- open by describing details of old cross:
	- moderate defenses, damaged gate
	- plinths for statues seem under construction with blank plaques
	- streets seem underpopulated
	- town mostly defined by roads through it
- party enters the only inn in town, finds [[Shortstack]] serving as waitress and bouncer
	- etar immediately leaves, looking for another inn (takes ~25m, does not find one)
	- shortstack tries to get the party to talk to minimal success.. but she does have some fun and prod them a bit
		- asks about the kid, gets "don't worry about it"
		- tells em that she can get em kicked out so they best behave
		- says she's upheld her side of the deal, and seems to have been more solidified in her devotion to [[Sylvaris]] by it ("Sylvaris helps those who help themselves")
		- pushes to see what they'll say about their time in [[Sefport]].. she knows more than she lets on, and she enjoys pushing the party's buttons. [[Friti Hernandez|Friti]] finds her perspective compelling.
	- after some impatience, Talia goes and finds Etar failing to locate any other inns and brings him back inside to eat. Shortstack tries to prod him a bit to limited success.
	- Talia asks Friti what he thinks of Shortstack
		- he says the idea of Sylvaris helping those who helps themselves feels right. that he's learned from his dad's mistakes and understands how to prioritize himself.
		- party does not like this perspective, but Friti is secure in it. he's predisposed to disagree with the party's perspective given how they've treated him.
	- some discussion about how likely it is that Friti's mom is alive. Etar says she's almost certainly dead, and Talia asserts that he's definitely alive. Friti doesn't want to hear it from either of them.
- when leaving, party gets to see the aftermath of the ogre siege. beheaded ogres, corpses and bones even across the road. no humanoids though. encampment has been burned down.
- party makes it to the mountains without incident and starts encountering weather difficulties. talia takes the worst of it, though all of friti, temple, and scan take some hit from the cold. etar is fine.
- bridge is out! locomotion amplifier *might* be able to get everyone across.. but the party doesn't know how it works with gravity. so they get scared. end up using pocket sphere, *misty step*, and *mending* wand to pull up the remains of the broken bridge and repair it. bridge isn't super safe but everyone makes it across (though talia was close due to the cold).
- after some more exhaustion, party makes it to one of the campsites along the route. there is some firewood in the cave, and they hear noises from deeper inside. have friti cast *alarm* to make sure they don't get ambushed. scan's *detect thoughts* gives insights about a tasty dwarf.. so the party almost decides to just rest with their precautions. but noah asks the question "what if it's another dwarf?".
- so the party investigates and discovers that it is, in fact, another dwarf. 

## Reflections

- overall: very happy with my experience of the session and how it was functionally.
- think i did a better job of description/tone-setting with old cross than i normally have. room for improvement, but the world felt more real to me and players' reaction felt like it was taking that into account.
- i enjoyed the chat with shortstack, and friti's presence allowed me to inject some of the nuance and interest where i might have felt underwhelmed otherwise. grant asking friti was really nice, as it led to some of the most interesting discussion imo.
- improv and exploration was much better than i was expecting. set bridge to 25ft to allow misty step, didn't think about locomotion amplifier at all. but there was *just* enough uncertainty that the party found a more mundane approach (sort of). wouldn't have been the worst if there just weren't much of a scene from it, but I liked how it turned out.
- mini-exhaustion felt like a win for both tone and mechanics. hurt grant in the combat, but that was part of the design.
- frost trolls were a fun fight. adequately interesting terrain, fun attempts with grant using *web*, oil/fire damage playing a real part, and the frost aura was putting in work. didn't use the dwarf as an alternate objective, which felt correct for the time/energy.
- defining the cave structure in response to party's questions created interesting components:
	- how are trolls in range of detect thoughts?
	- why would they not have noticed the extension of the cave before settling down? (elevation)
	- what do the trolls think/say to indicate that something is afoot?
- that's not how oil works but that's okay. rolling with it and adjusting once i look things up felt like the right approach, and i feel validated in that choice.

1342 Winter 7 (afternoon) - 1342 Winter 7 (evening)
## Session Description

The party's initial attempts to find a path forward have been unsuccessful. After saving [[Salvador Hernandez]] from a group of hobgoblins, they must use their wits and knowledge to identify a new path forward. Fortunately, there are many such paths available.
## Recap

>When last we left our heroes, they grilled their captive assassin for details about the organization that sent him, presuming him to be affiliated with their enemies in the [[Black Hand]]. With some light intrusion into his mind, Scan and Talia were able to identify that he picked up his assignments from a dead drop location near an inn in Ressek Corner. After turning him over to the [[Sunguard]], they all headed over to [[Salvador Hernandez]] to debrief about their excursion with [[Friti Hernandez|Friti]] and about the kidnapping of Leo Demacras. After some back-and-forth, their discussion was interrupted as clouds of smoke entered the room and coalesced into hobgoblins intent on slaying the head of the Sunguard. But some quick thinking and brutal efficiency made sure that there was never a real threat, and the hobgoblins were all dispatched.

## Questions
- What can Salvador offer the heroes?
	- General access?
		- Concerned about shapeshifters. If players can come up with a suitable answer, maybe he'll go for it. Special privileges for saving his life.
		- Does have some concern about the long con. Understands that he is one of the primary threat vectors to the city, and overextending his trust could cost him. Alleviated a bit by affidavit from Sefport (maybe following up in background to verify). Though recognizes that it would be an odd plan. He's seen weirder, though.
	- Expanded array of basic (magical?) weaponry
		- Will take a couple of days to get stuff ready.
		- Should enable the heroes to take on devils and other such creatures without major disadvantages.
- What's Friti's plan? What does he know?
	- Knows of the artifact
	- Knows that Azarel has figured out where it is
	- Has been unable to get that location
	- Azarel is going to need an expedition to find it. heroes could go on an expedition? Probably will take some time to find a suitable group, but heroes could expedite the process given their familiarity with Azarel. Alternatively, Friti has his own ideas.
	- Definitely isn't going to do anything stupid.. unless?
- What's happening with the interrogation of Osvin? On what timescale?
	- Salvador may push to expedite information-gathering
	- Probably still takes a few days
- What's Aris up to?
	- Finding a place to stay, maybe just diving deeper into her work?
	- With a day or two's preparation and resources, Cailana is able to determine that he's not within X miles of the city.
	- After insistence and threatening to resign, Aris gets the institution to budge and divert resources toward locating Leo. Scrying fails, suggesting he's either not on this plane or shielded from scrying.

## Current Threads

#### Aftermath

**Tone:** Serious, thoughtful
**Tension**: Salvador is displeased and distressed by what has happened, but still does not have an especially high opinion of the heroes. He's going to worry about his people, and the heroes aren't really included in that.

Takes place in [[Salvador Hernandez#House]]

- [[Friti Hernandez]] comes into the room, outrunning [[Anton Estevez]]. has a fire bolt cooking, fires into ceiling to avoid hitting heroes. knocks down a chandelier instead
- [[Salvador Hernandez]] appears next to Scan and commands immediate authority. Has a small gash in his clothes and some scorch marks, but is relatively healthy.
	- Surveys the hobgoblins, ashes, and splatter. 
	- Immediately focuses on being practical and competent. Coordinates with [[Anton Estevez]] about enlisting help from the nobles.
	- Doublet is torn, makes a comment that Anton will need to go to the tailor to get it repaired.
	- Chastises Friti for leaving safety. Suggests that he may not be able to attend the Mage's College if he cannot be trusted to keep himself safe. Sends him to his room. (Friti casts *message* to Etar after he leaves).
	- Hasn't really acknowledged the heroes yet and intends to head out. 
if anyone makes a case or emphasizes the immediacy of talia's father:
- salvador pauses and sighs. criticizes the heroes for failing to understand the scope of duty and obligation, but admits that talia deserves a shot.
- isolates Talia, asks what her father means to her. can give her a sizable red gem, symbolic and the nobles of the city will recognize what it means. "my wife would kill me, but i can only hope she would understand".
--
- salvador does not give a shit if the players trust him. they can ask things of him, he can provide or not provide, and he's done explaining. he's got a *job to do*.
- salvador appreciates what they have done but does not have a particularly high opinion of mercenaries, nor how they got here. count nicodemus is an old friend, but not exactly a figure of great repute. saving his life is fairly inconsequential. he knows enough blades - monsters show up, you do your job. doesn't mean anything about your values or conviction.
#### Friti Asks for Help

**Tone:** Lighthearted, crazy
**Tension:** Is Etar going to agree to help Friti? What is Friti going to do if left alone?

- starts after friti casts *message* to Etar and Etar finds his way to Friti's room.
- figure out visual/description for Friti's room. Set the scene flavor-wise, not just practically.
	- same child's bedroom as before. desk, bed, books. reaches under his bed and pulls out scrawled set of notes.
- Friti is excited that Etar showed up! if anyone else is there, he'll pretend he has no idea what etar's talking about.
- peeks outside his room to make sure nobody's outside. secrecy is very important.
- quizzes Etar on why they went to Azarel in the first place.
- explains his brilliant plan - that he thinks his mother is out there somewhere, and the Eye is the key to finding her. knows that it's a relic somehow tied to locating individuals, and she and Azarel were researching it together previously.
- tries persistently to get buy-in from Etar before giving details of what he's trying to do.
- secrecy from Salvador is very important.

What's Friti's plan? What does he know?
- Knows of the artifact
- Knows that Azarel has figured out where it is
- Has been unable to get that location
- Azarel is going to need an expedition to find it. heroes could go on an expedition? Probably will take some time to find a suitable group, but heroes could expedite the process given their familiarity with Azarel. Or.. they could head out on their own. Would be faster. Get stuff done.
- Definitely isn't going to do anything stupid.. unless?
#### Seeking the Claw

**Tone:** Uncertain, chaos!
**Tension:** Will the heroes survive the attack of the air elemental? How do they navigate the discussions with the police captain? (Inspector Malgrave, red dragonborn)

Speeding things up:
- initiative is for chumps
- plan ahead for monster turns
- average damage with some arbitrary variation
- announce "on-deck"
players:
- noah/anna have your dice ready and roll once
- know what you're gonna do

battlefield: alley.
distinctive combat features: mud? burning terrain from fireball. building is burning? alternative objective.
little water tap on side of  building
barkeep/patrons come out to see what happened
air elemental can fly
todo: finish making custom stat block (nah not happening, wing it)

sunguard should show up and be competent. not "save the day" but functionally end the encounter. will interrogate heroes on how they got here.
nonconsensual mind probing is outlawed in the city. not easy to enforce, but admitting to it wouldn't serve them well.

clue at the scene? note for another address would be appropriate, though i don't know if there's anyone they'd care about. can allow them to continue pursuing this direction if they want to. may need to establish more about the claw. or maybe this puts them more formally on the claw's radar as a proper threat that needs to be addressed more directly.

## Options

#### Connecting with Azarel

**Tone:** Slow, procedural.
**Tension:** Can the heroes get approval to take on this expedition?

- Looking to gather folks for an expedition for the Eye of Etheril.
- Is going to take time and process. If they just sit back, would be weeks.
- Party needs to prove themselves capable to College leadership if they're going to earn the contract conventionally
	- Alternative party is absolutely 100% affiliated with the Black Hand somehow.. though they probably don't know it.
- College needs things done.. so doing a favor could earn them an in.
- Would ask for name and background for formal records and application.
#### Devil Hunters

**Tone:** Light, drama
**Tension:** Does the Order care about the heroes' request? What timeline is it going to be taken up on? 

Organization: Mind of the Order

Person: Amalia Elderstar (Elf). Attitude: Patient, cautious. 

Origin: Older than the [[Silver Blade]], but now includes many of its members.
Drama: Tension between old guard (exploring and anticipating trouble, research; [[Gidara]]/[[Myskili]]) and new guard (trying to clear the wilderness without requisite forces; [[Sylvaris]]/[[Raxus]]).

Function: Assess extraplanar threats. This branch is unaware of any connection between devils and the [[Black Hand]]. Considers the organization to be a problem "of mortals".

Branch of the [[Septenary Order]].
#### The Mage's College

**Tone:** Old, mystical
**Tension:** Will the heroes be able to make headway in such an institution? Why should they and their threat be taken seriously?

Origin: Older than the [[War from Below]]. 
Values: Progress and discovery.

Spread across the city. What specifically are the players looking for?

Fuck it we ball.
#### Devilish Dreams

**Tone:** Dark, emotional
**Tension:** Will Talia take the devil up on his offer? How much does she care about 

- grant meditates on memories of his dad throughout his life
- start describing one of them, then some dramatic scene change happens (time.. stops?) and devil shows up
- say that the devil's going to talk at talia for a bit, so if grant wants to speak up he can and must interrupt me. otherwise he'll keep going.
>Ah, that must be your father. Barely recognize him, what without the cuts and burns all over his body. Real shame, that.
>See, it seems you've made an enemy of one of my neighbors. Ambitious, that one. Has an.. interesting arrangement with that tyrant of yours. 
>What you did in Sefport, that was nice. I think you managed to surprise our mutual acquaintance when you showed that this country might have some fight left in it yet... even with its leadership crippled. Good. Maybe he'll learn some humility.
>
>But I should focus myself. After all, I'm not here to chat extraplanar politics. I'm here to offer you a gift.
>I'd very much like if our friend found himself with a couple more setbacks on his journey, and I have reason to believe that your father's abduction serves some function in his scheme. So let's foil it, shall we?
>I'm fairly limited in what I can provide you, and I'm sure you're aware that my kind are generally fond of the "strings attached" sort of gifts. But I can give you a direction, and who's to say what happens after that? Ah, but there is one *real* condition, of course: secrecy. You can take your friends along for the ride, but they cannot know of me. Anyone finds out about this offer, and we might find ourselves at odds. And I don't think either of us wants that. Good luck!

suddenly, the meditation shatters altogether, your family disappearing as you open your eyes to this room you've chosen for the night. as you orient yourself, you feel a burning sensation in your pocket that feels like it sears your skin through your cloak. then after a second, it fades to a warm glow. when you reach into your pocket, you find a business card, two inches by three and a half inches. on the front, it simply reads "a gift". on the back, there's an address of a place in the northeast of the Mage Quarter. below it, just the word "discovery".

## Notes

- Laid out a little bit of the relationship around the estate and the Nenzune family with [[Salvador Hernandez]]'s discussion with [[Anton Estevez]].
- Salvador tries to isolate Talia to connect with her about her father and offer her the family gem for influence within the city.
- Talia first tries to offer to talk in the open, then insists on inviting Scan along into the discussion with Salvador. Salvador tries to assess Talia and the party as a threat, given that Talia's father is substantial leverage. Scan is adequately reassuring, but Salvador will still have his eye out.
- Talia turns down the offer of the gem.
- Meanwhile, Friti tries to get Etar alone to talk to him about a plan to go after the [[Eye of Etheril]]. Shenanigans with Temple ensue after Etar's excuse of looking for the wine cellar goes awry, but they do get there eventually.
- Talia checks in with Friti and offers condolences about having a father like Salvador, gives him a hug.
- Party discusses plans. Scan likes the official route, but Talia is dead-set on following Friti's plan through.
- Looking to regroup with Friti tomorrow at midday.
## Reflections

- grant made good commentary that dice rolls are good
- would be cool to see dav more willing to take a stand about the law. grant agrees.
- anna did better though still hard to assess focus.
- noah's "it's a bomb" ?? whatever idk
- one of my favorite sessions to run. felt prepared, lots of RP, grant really coming into his own.

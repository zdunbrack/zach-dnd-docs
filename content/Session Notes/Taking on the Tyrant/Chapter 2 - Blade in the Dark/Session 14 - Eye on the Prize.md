1342 Winter 8 (midday) - 1342 Winter 8 (afternoon)
## Session Description

After a busy morning of folks going on their own, they regroup to discuss what they've learned and plan to infiltrate the [[Mage's College]]'s hall of records. Then, they wrap up business in the city before heading north toward the Kharesti Mountains.
## Recap

>When last we left our heroes, they all managed to stay conscious against the air elemental who defended the dead drop spot of the [[Drake's Claw]]. After a brief run-in with Captain Malgrave of the Sunguard, they finally got some proper rest in an inn, not wanting to head back to the Demacras residence after the Claw's attack. In the morning, they split up to hunt down some personal interests before looking to regroup with [[Friti Hernandez]] and establish a plan to obtain information about Azarel's expedition.

## Heist

#### Debrief

ornamented guards outside the house. arrogant, harsh. insistent that heroes don't bring weapons into the house. don't care what they've done.

friti gets held up when leaving the house, asking where he's going.
says some friends got detention, so he's going to pop by and check in on them. gets skeptical looks, commentary about how he shouldn't be friends with people in detention. casts message to talia to say "i'll be out in a minute, new guards are being obnoxious"

friti knows:
- ike and orifina managed to get into the archives by picking the lock but ms. connin came in at a bad time
- guard at the elevator, unclear how much of an obstacle. didn't mind the students.
- archives are on fifth floor, though not sure how easy it will be to find the documents they want.
#### Preparation

this one's pretty much just up to the heroes. do they want to do any preparations? who's going in? how many? do they want to buy anything beforehand?
#### Execution

obstacles:
- first floor/reception (can you blend in?)
	- receptionist/administrator. Pauline Connin, "the Archivist".
		- human, redhead with a pixie cut.
		- normally handles document stuff herself, so expectation would not be that she lets folks do it.
		- password is "open sesame"
		- has sticky note of password under her desk
	- one sunguard "campus police" at elevator. dwarf, named Muirdan.
		- personality: tired of students' nonsense, unhappy to be here
		- failure condition: give a check (performance?), DC10. without that, he'll say "look i don't know what you're up to, but I've seen enough dumbass students to recognize when someone's up to something." 
- door into admin area
	- locked (obviously)
	- noise alarms
	- have some benches, mysterious orbs in the corners of the room
		- cat door underneath benches. after some amount of time, felix (cat) comes out
	- failure condition: can't open door, noise alarm. animal handling check with cat
- flitting orbs overhead, with personality.
	- they're the mechanism for accessing files
	- obnoxiously curious
	- slightly competitive, looking at different places in the room for documents.
	- cat inside. named felix.
	- failure condition: don't be convincing to the orbs (charisma check). consequences: suspicion/alarm
- drawer isn't persistently open. will need to explain to the orbs why the document should go back so soon. or depends on what they're going to do with it. that's fairly open-ended, not sure how much i can prep that. situation exists, though.
## Heading Out

#### The Claw, Again
tension: these guards will be less receptive than Malgrave about violations of process. so what information gets out is very important.
Osvin is very skittish and uncooperative. seems quite distressed

should they really be able to interrogate their prisoner? probably not in a private, formal investigation setting. they can "visit" the prisoner, but they're not with the Sunguard. so they're not performing official duties.

upon seeing the heroes, Osvin will call out the heroes for abuse beyond the domain of self-defense. guards will have mixed reactions. how much am i willing to give consequences? believe it was primarily talia?

- they can threaten that the claw would assume he talked, if they want
- at first, he won't believe the heroes.. then he will change his tune and be absolutely terrified
- will spill the beans on everything he knows and beg, *plead* with the heroes to follow up on leads
	- pray for some kind of witness protection for his family (wife and young child)
	- give what he knows about single point of contact he had. name is Baltan, a private guard in western Bright Point.

#### Sayonara, Sunguard

new guards outside the house gates, adorned in ostentatious platemail. greatswords at their sides, plumed helmets on their heads.

will insist that heroes leave all weapons behind and perform a thorough search before allowing them to enter the manor grounds. they're not pleasant or gentle about it.

[[Anton Estevez]] is at the door and greets them.

describe the foyer:
- dark wooden floors, red carpet up the center. candles and torches in sconces lining the walls, bathing the room in a flickering light. 
- various paintings around the room - some portraits of individuals you don't recognize, some landscapes, and some paintings of what can only be the Hernandez family.

Anton calls up and Salvador comes doawn from the stairs, hanging out on the landing. heavy steps, slow and methodical.
- friti said he'd be traveling with you. he didn't tell me what you were doing or why, but i can infer what i need to know. and what has not been shared, i don't need to know.
- i know my son. whatever he's after, it must relate to my Maria.
- but i cannot afford distractions. i cannot afford hope, not at a time like this. i have a city to be responsible for.
paces across the landing, sort of shadowboxing with his sword. looks down from the balcony at Talia
- i see how you look at me, your judgment, shame. i am not blind. i know what people say about this house, this family. that it crumbles from within. that i am unfit to raise my son.
- and perhaps you're right. they say it takes a village to raise a child, and i am no village.
looks at painting of Maria with Friti in her arms, Salvador alongside.. slashes it, separating him from his from family, gives a wry smile.
- there. call it an.. updated portrait.
- i remember when friti came back after your journey to azarel's tower. there was a light in his eyes that i have not seen in too long. take him. allow him to live the life he could not do here. give him hope, where i cannot. give him the support he deserves.
- but talia? should there come a moment where you must decide between what's best for my son or your father.. i suggest you choose the family that has something worth saving.
- good luck. i expect you'll need it.
he turns and slashes at the wall one more time with his sword as he heads up the stairs and retreats.

work in Brilliance, Radiance, Candor, Zeal ?

## Reflections

- really good until it wasn't. i think my session prep worked out quite well, with an appropriate dose of surprise at the players' choices.
- the task of running a table, though.. i'm less confident in my role there than i was coming in. of course it's a group effort of not communicating and suffering the consequences, but it feels like it's on *me*. and seeing how tough Noah's been taking it, that's not an easy responsibility to bear - deservedly so or not.
- scheduling changes were very good, glad that we had a dinner after this and didn't have to end the night on it.

**Key Events**:
- make it to to [[Laskar]]
- meet with [[Salvador Hernandez]], get a quest (investigate wizard's tower with his kid?)
- come back
	- side quest in between?
- parent abducted/killed - put some drama in it
	- plot hole risk: aris should be alerted if talia re-enters town.
	- resolution: she thought the alert stopped working after triggering once and was confused, but brushed it off. that or she wasn't home, but that gives the players less information.
- salvador/kid have theory about wife's disappearance, kid takes them to wife's office? or brings them the results. that might be better because i don't know if i want to do that scene.
	- salvador is able to get in contact with senior diviner at the college. gets info on azuma but also fails to come up with anything for his wife.. but knows she's alive.
- spell component for scrying ?
- some dungeon out there with a relic related to teleportation ("the eye")? bring salvador himself with them? hunting down and traveling to another plane


**Themes:**
- ***Setting***: big magical city and open plains. dungeons!
- ***Scope***: still regional for now. want to stabilize the region with the silver blades. then next up is the red rangers
- ***Setting Events***: Monsters in the plains are relatively well-handled, but culture is perhaps too ambitious. 
- ***Danger***: moderate
- ***Goals***: Understand what's needed to fight back against the Black Hand. Get buy-in and get going. Stop Laskar from being invaded.
- ***Game Style***: Proving their competency against monsters with violence and adventuring. 
- ***Levity***: Bringing some more reality and darkness into it. Heavier stuff was off-screen before (they *kidnap* people ??) - time to bring it to life.


**Ideas**:

kill one of grant's parents (okay maybe just kidnap them and gloat)

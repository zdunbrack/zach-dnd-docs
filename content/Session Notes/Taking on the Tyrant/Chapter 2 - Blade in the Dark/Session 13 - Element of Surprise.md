1342 Winter 7 (evening) - 1342 Winter 8 (morning)
## Session Description

The party deals with last week's mess of a fireball and an air elemental. Then, they try to learn about the [[Eye of Etheril]] and establish a plan with [[Friti Hernandez]].
## Recap

>When last we left our heroes, they dealt with the aftermath of the hobgoblins' attempt on the life of [[Salvador Hernandez]]. Talia and Scan chatted with Salvador and declined his offer of a family heirloom that could help her gain favor with the nobles of the city. Meanwhile, Etar and Temple connected with Friti about a scheme to hunt down the [[Eye of Etheril]], a relic with the potential to see people in faraway places. After some discussion about the available paths, the party went to Ressek Corner to hunt down their lead on the [[Drake's Claw]] - before Talia was rudely interrupted by a fireball and air elemental arising from the cobblestones.
## Questions

- What is common knowledge about the [[Eye of Etheril]]? What is in the expedition documentation? What does Azarel know? What does nobody know?
	- "common" knowledge:
		- involved in [[War from Below]]
		- believed to linger somewhere in [[The Deep]]
		- used by the drow Etheril
	- expedition documentation:
		- more specifics about its location within the Deep
		- plan as to how to enter in the Kharesti Mountains (Battletop Caves)
		- notes as to other entrances considered
	- [[Phineas Azarel]]:
		- potential as a source of power and teleportation
		- more specific history
	- Nobody:
		- [[Black Hand]] is after it.
## The Right Side of the Law

**Tone:** Uncertain, chaos!
**Tension:** Will the heroes survive the attack of the air elemental? How do they navigate the discussions with the police captain?
#### Fighting Fire With Steel

Speeding things up:
- initiative is for chumps
- plan ahead for monster turns
- average damage with some arbitrary variation
- announce "on-deck"
players:
- noah/anna have your dice ready and roll once
- know what you're gonna do
battlefield: alley.
distinctive combat features: mud? burning terrain from fireball. building is burning? alternative objective.
little water tap on side of  building
barkeep/patrons come out to see what happened
air elemental can fly

![[Pasted image 20250504022648.png]]
reaction: after being hit, elemental moves on top of attacker, not provoking opportunity attacks. extinguishes fire along the path. 

bucket exist but they're mostly ineffective, using air elemental's whirlwind is much more reliable.

clue at the scene? note for another address would be appropriate, though i don't know if there's anyone they'd care about. can allow them to continue pursuing this direction if they want to. may need to establish more about the claw. or maybe this puts them more formally on the claw's radar as a proper threat that needs to be addressed more directly.

whirlwind into wall will set folks on fire but also put out fire? we'll see.
#### Some Simple Questions

Captain Malgrave, red dragonborn
wants to establish peace and go home. 

Innkeeper: changeling, elf form. 

sunguard should show up and be competent. not "save the day" but functionally end the encounter. will interrogate heroes on how they got here.
nonconsensual mind probing is outlawed in the city. not easy to enforce, but admitting to it wouldn't serve them well.
#### Side Scenes

devil speech in grant's dreams

Library - basic research results?
## The Wrong Side of the Law

#### The Morning

Church: See [[Session 12 - New Directions#Devil Hunters]]

Library: See [[Session 13 - Element of Surprise#Questions]]
#### Planning with Friti

[[Friti Hernandez]]

friendos caught trying to snoop around.

layout?
what security measures? flying automatons on patrol, just other folks around.
large elevator (wind tunnel-ish), documents are on fifth floor.

security is mostly *inside* the floor rather than at the entrance, but papers are expected.

documents alphabetized by professor (will give real document next week) 
friti recommends vendor at market who sells spell crystals - like scrolls but without limitations on who can cast them. 

what obstacles are in their way?
- paranoia about how they want to get inside
- folks questioning what they're doing here, if they're looking like adventurers.
- locked door with doggie door. cat-sized, too small for anyone to make it through. friti's friends have a knock for lockpicking
- some other employee
#### Going In

let's see how it goes! wing it and react
## Notes

- opened with combat. talia and temple kinda got owned (rolled extremely well on damage), showed off that elemental could put out some of the fire.
- etar used his items in fun and cool ways. tried to blipbulb up and grapple elemental down after it fled, but it's immune to "grappled" unfortunately.
- combat lasted about four rounds, then folks were already starting to help put out the fire.
- group pressed by captain malgrave to explain how they got here. he only saw them doing good work so lets them off easy.
	- talia was interested in his arm, thought it was magical bolts but not quite
	- scan gave info about how they found the drake's claw. malgrave may want to follow up with the [[Septenary Order]].
- party stayed in an inn near talia's house. skipped the scene with the devil though may retcon it into existence to introduce complexity and context.
- each character was able to spend the morning doing one "thing"
	- talia went to get a magical weapon of some kind - limited to apprentice-level work, so we'll see what that means.
	- etar went to look into logistics about heading to rockbottom
	- scan and temple went to the [[Septenary Order]] and talked with [[Amalia Elderstar]] about the devil problem they've been dealing with.
- party regroups to talk to friti, but we call session there

## Reflections

- man i was just not all there today. was glad to call it out explicitly, but i really hoped i'd find my energy and just didn't do it.
- as always, starting late really cripples pacing.
- combat went alright, I think.
	- elemental meant that combat was somewhat one-dimensional, but that was okay.
	- whirlwind ability (no recharge) worked reasonably well. initiative order was awkward in terms of how it worked out. may want to rig initiative in future to create the outcomes i'm hoping for
	- noah didn't realize karga's club was magical.
	- need to bump up enemy AC if flanking is going to be assumed as a default. hitting all the time was fine at low levels to keep things snappy, but with two attacks per turn it means that enemy health pools drain very quickly.
	- party plays scared, but nobody even got knocked out. still room to push the envelope (and this was them without all their tools!)
- post-combat was fine, but maybe should have had more stakes. having trouble navigating the authenticity/metagame info of what NPCs ask about
- dinner order cut pacing more than i was expecting. was hoping to get one more scene in, but nobody was super engaged. maybe a consequence of my lack of energy to carry, maybe also noah and anna being kinda out of it.
- felt like the third-person "here's their perspective" and keeping things at a high level worked pretty well for the energy level I had. maybe could have made scenes about stuff, but mostly wanted to get to Friti and progress - which didn't ultimately happen.
- really should lock in details of prep sooner. not sure how to establish a concrete cadence but should be done.

survey notes:
- dav really liked the church scene, establishing that the world has more important things than them
- dav felt like the combat was unengaging from a tactical perspective since positioning/etc. weren't optimal
- definitely need to establish mechanical/flavor stakes for something like the fire. establish that players need to interact with it sooner
	- emotional stakes with clear consequences for failure could also substitute for trying to imply urgency
- grant liked the combat lol so mixed reviews.
- eye contact in conversations when dav is primary POC can feel exclusive.
	- TODO: figure out how to engage the table, ask other people, spread out my attention.
- grant would like some more nuance in dav's character. he's "practical and focused on order", but what else?
- anna liked it? i mean sure i guess
- noah liked both the combat and downtime
- noah got frustrated at lack of clarity as to whether he can do grapple air elemental.
	- maybe allow a roll? grant failed to restrain earlier in same session with web, so that's some intuition. but transparency in mechanics is a tricky topic.
- noah enjoyed the scene with malgrave apparently
- combat was definitely on the easy side, fire pressure not working meant it didn't really have oomph

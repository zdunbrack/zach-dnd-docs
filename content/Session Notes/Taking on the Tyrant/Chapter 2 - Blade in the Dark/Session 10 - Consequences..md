1342 Winter 6 (evening) - 1342 Winter 7 (morning)
## Session Description

The party is feeling pretty good after dealing with the lizardfolk necromancer and making it into the basement of the tower. They take the chance to relax and chat with Phineas Azarel before returning to Laskar and finding that things are not as they left them...
## Recap

>When last we left our heroes, they scared off some kobolds and cleared a lizardman necromancer out of Azarel's Tower. After repairing the four orbs and laying them onto the appropriate pillars, our party finally descended into the basement, where they found a larger pillar and orb whose interior resembled a library...

## Questions

- Why did [[Friti Hernandez]] \[really\] want to come to this tower?
	- Wants to prove himself to his dad by doing something flashy and magical
	- Azarel knew his mother (before) and can tell him about her
	- Has heard of the [[Eye of Etheril]] and wants to use it to find her
- What has [[Phineas Azarel]] learned?
	- General function: With some restrictions/danger (rumor), it can teleport large groups to a particular location, irrespective of planar boundaries
	- Location: Lost underground in the Kharesti Mountains, somewhere in the Underdark.
- What does the [[Eye of Etheril]] do?
	- Common function: identifies location of individual across planes. Not quite scrying, but somewhere in between.
	- Requires support: travel to that location. how does returning work? artifact left behind?
- What rewards (consumables, cash) will Azarel offer?
	- magic breadcrumbs (crumbs of conjuration)
	- vine whip of conjoinment (whip weapon 15ft range, when hits a creature you can bring them adjacent to you in a space of your choice)
	- miniature locomotion amplifier (3x3 around self, forcibly moves all creatures regardless of willingness up to 30'. no targeting allowed. action to use.)
	- tiny pocket dimension (size of a baseball, practically unbreakable. interior can hold a single Medium creature)
- How are we sneaking in a combat? (Assassins, probably).
	- talia: make a perception check (something seems off, you know this city)
	- or else they attack the house directly? could be a dynamic combat from all sides, party separated.
	- supernatural or ordinary?
## The Tower

#### The Basement

Dim lighting, faint flickers from the walls. Diagrams of some of the inventions and tools that Phineas has worked on. Some scorch marks on the walls, and lots of dust. Contrast to the upper floors in the absence of natural light. stale odor and notably quiet compared to upstairs.. though maybe after some time they 
#### The Library

Angel: Ausus
- radiant angel, 10' tall with massive wings and a mace and shield strapped to his back. 
Dwarf: Phineas Azarel
- see mini - balding, ratty clothes

 Vibe: massive table in the center, with sketches (bulletin boards) and more tables strewn across the room. school library was fancy with white marble; this room is more warm and welcoming. has a *bunch* of chairs and benches around every table, as though this could serve as a social research space.

bookshelves start 10' off the ground, until the ceiling at 20'. unseen servant moves around with ladders to reorganize things.

makeshift bath somewhere, makeshift bed on one of the couches. conjured items (conjuration wizard)
#### Teleportation Circle
 
Powered up now that the orbs are all in place.
Azarel can use it to get them back home
## A Home.. Changed.

#### Back Home.. Almost

[[Aris Demacras]] is happy to see them! Confused if they took teleportation circle as she didn't get notified.. again. Comments on it offhandedly that she'll need to talk to Cailana.

Note from Leo:

>Aris,
>
>Our daughter returned while you were at the College. Friends have been captured by ruffians outside the city. She came home to lead a rescue effort - proud of her and happy to help.
>
>Be back soon.
>- Leo
#### Friti and Salvador

Salvador has not come across any critical info yet - talked to the college about locating [[Azuma Essylt]] but they say they'll need time. Has his own suspicions.
#### Ambush!

## Notes

- Slow start (from my perspective) as Dav had his concerns about getting trapped, but nobody wanted to do anything about it nor thought of any clever ways to protect themselves. Had a vague idea to blockade the door, but nothing that gave them the confidence to just dive in.
- They heard chitchat (hologram) from upstairs and found some kobolds bringing a new body in the cart and picking up the corpses of their lizardfolk compatriots. Talia added them to the corpse pile and stuck behind while the others went into the library.
- They met Phineas Azarel and his celestial companion Ausus. Friti connected with Azarel a bit and got some information, while the party mostly hung out until they were ready to leave.
- Tried to haggle their way into more than the two magical trinkets they were offered. Scan was very unsuccessful, but Talia came in and made a very convincing argument that they would each get one.
- Azarel set up the teleportation circle and they made it back to Laskar. It was evening, so the party ate and returned home to discover Aris's confusion that Leo was not with them. She showed the note she found, and the party started theorizing what might have happened.
- As they were about to head to the Mage's College to see if they could meet with Cailana, there was a knock on the door from Capital Mail - a letter for Talia. A warning from the Black Hand.
- The party runs around the city trying to gather information - first to the College (where Cailana is not), then Cailana's house, then the gate where Leo and "Talia" would have left. They have a couple of directions to look between Salvador, the College, and independent investigation. But it's late at this point, so they decide to head to bed around 11.
- No long rest for you! Mysterious agents come to murder the party in their sleep. They don't succeed. Crossbowmen outside do chip damage but flee once the thugs start to fall. Etar throws one out of the window, then he runs back around. Final thug jumps out the window and tries to get away, but a Command from Scan to "halt" and a sucker punch from Etar knocks him out cold. They take his unconscious form inside for a subsequent interrogation and actually get a good night's sleep.
## Reflections

- players/characters have no flair, flavor, or anything! haven't really thought about it to this degree before, but interaction with phineas and their investigation really settled it for me. let's make a scene, please! it can't be collaborative storytelling if i'm doing everything beyond the occasional quip
- try to see if we can keep momentum thru dinner instead of taking a break.. though that requires some consistency or plan around food. maybe figure out before we start?
- combat evaluation: mixed bag but positive overall (it is still combat)
	- didn't really figure out how i wanted lights mechanic to work and it showed - didn't do anything because it mostly would have just made things worse for anna and she doesn't  take adversity particularly well
	- improvised which weapons were around and where, could have been better if i'd thought about that from a design standpoint
	- dav called out anti-synergy between knockdowns and rangers. enemies aren't perfectly tactical, not really the point. like it's there but they're also covering different problems.
- entire lead-up/intro to combat felt clunky but got there. i think a point of weakness but improves with practice. need a vision for how i want it to feel and go.
	- etar asking talia about a drink in the middle of the night was really good improvisation. as with many things - simple but *creates* something and is built on character.
	- should think about my feelings around the whole "don't take a long rest yet!" where what's happening is foreshadowed.. I feel like the players are impatient and just trying to get it over with, which doesn't feel good or fun.
- very unhappy with players' attitudes - interrupted during descriptions, party repeatedly describes evaluations based on their guess for what i'm going for. i don't care what you think i'm going for; i care what your characters want to do. so have them want to do something and we'll follow you.

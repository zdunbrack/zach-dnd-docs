1342 Winter 7 (morning) - 1342 Winter 7 (afternoon)
## Session Description

Leo Demacras is missing, taken by the [[Black Hand]]. [[Salvador Hernandez]] owes the heroes a favor. Talia got a letter from [[Latimer]] warning against further involvement. The game is in the players' hands. What's their move?
## Recap

>When last we left our heroes, they freed [[Phineas Azarel]] from his personal library and brought [[Friti Hernandez|Friti]] back to [[Laskar]]. When they arrived, they discovered that Leo Demacras was missing - and after a largely fruitless investigation, an ominous letter arrived in which the Black Hand claimed credit for his disappearance. But when our party finally decided it was time to rest, some assassins rudely decided that rest would have to wait. One short scuffle later, and our heroes find themselves with a captive primed for interrogation...
## Questions

	- they'll have some leadership that the party can hunt down if they really want to, but it won't get them anything.
	- bandits have 40gp ea. on them - payment for the job

	- Also can pay the heroes for their help with Friti
- what does [[Friti Hernandez]] expect or want from the heroes?
	- heist to get records for what [[Salvador Hernandez]] requested of the [[Mage's College]] regarding his mother?

	- contacts.. etar? via *message* while party is waiting around

## Following Leads

#### A Captive Audience

Party has assassin (Osvin, Russian-ish) from the Drake's Claw tied up in the Demacras household, with a couple corpses strewn about as well.

Organization is decentralized, "contract shows up and we do it" sort of deal. Going to try to equivocate assassin work with other mercenary work. Won't talk too much because he's more scared of their leadership than these guys. No matter how threatening these guys are.

Got paid a bit in advance. [[Aris Demacras]] will be inclined to turn him into the [[Sunguard]], will also take care of cleaning up the bodies. When turning him in, the Sunguard will check for and find scars on his chest indicating membership with the Claw.

#### Syncing with Salvador

Same setup as last time - ring the bell, butler ([[Anton Estevez]]) comes out to greet them. Takes them into the house, but Salvador is waiting there this time, knowing they'd be coming since Friti is back.

Says that he was able to call on some favors with the [[Mage's College]] to locate [[Azuma Essylt]]. Some process he had to work around or push through, but the College understands that the Sunguard is important to them, including having a division as campus police. Followed values of candor and zeal to make things happen.

Learned that Azuma is in Rockbottom, a small town in the Naiview Highlands. Has taken on a role as some kind of minor local leader. Black Hand and Ikara have not expanded into that area yet; still restricted to Corofell Wood, Murasi Wilds, and some part of the Kharesti Mountains.

If the party accuses or inquires as to how their names got associated, [[Salvador Hernandez]] will explain the principles of the [[Sunguard]]. He will be principled and insistent, and it may lead to some tension. But he is grateful for the party stopping [[Latimer]] in [[Sefport]] and bringing the warning to [[Laskar]].

#### Ambush! (Again)

## Notes

Ambushed outside city. Present location unclear. Injured, stable. Fiends abound.

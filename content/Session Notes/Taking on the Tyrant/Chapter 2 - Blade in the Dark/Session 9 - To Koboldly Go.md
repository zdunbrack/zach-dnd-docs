Desired flow:

2. Explore first couple of floors, figure out the scope of the situation
3. Explore seasonal rooms, another combat encounter or two alongside puzzle solving.
4. Encounter necromancer

Need to define:
1. Why are the orbs currently not working? (maybe only some of them aren't)
2. Why is Azarel trapped? (power connection downstairs is severed due to interference)
3. What is Friti looking for? (information on his mother and her research)
	1. What does he find? (Azarel, information on the Eye)

## Session Description

The party approaches [[Azarel's Tower]] as a favor for [[Salvador Hernandez]], accompanying his son Friti. As expected, dangers and knowledge lurk within.
## Recap

>When last we left our heroes, they arrived in Laskar and explored what the city had to offer. They cashed in on the invitation they had received from the Tunnel Snakes and sought out Salvador Hernandez to discuss the plans of the Black Hand. The party then spent the night at the Demacras residence before heading out with Salvador's son Friti to explore Azarel's Tower and discover what lays within.

## The Tower

#### The Rooms

Real:
- Entrance (1st floor) - guards. Has four god-aligned pedestals in the corner, empty. Lines on the floor connect them to a circle in the middle of the room.
- Pocket dimension storage (2nd floor) - orb investigation. orbs outlined with lines for power to go through.
	- Battery checker sort of deal - shows energy going in, but not going out
- Teleportation circle (3rd floor/roof), 
Pocket Dimensions:
- Winter: Dark and snowy. Snow globe where heating elements melting the snow have frozen up. Ghouls and ghasts buried in the snow? Also need to find their way back to the return platform.
- Spring: Rainy marshlands. Lightning, Frankenstein, necromancer's current home. Problem: energy is being diverted to operating table.
- Summer: Harsh sunlight, very dry. Harmonic blooms (ender pearls). Magical connection is organic, needs to be watered.
- Autumn: Overgrown greenhouse. Has chorus plants (harmony plants), some basic farming tools, and notes on their growth. Magic connection is crowded out by overgrowth.
- Library: (large) Orb on one of basement pedestals. Inaccessible because of kobold/lizardman meddling.
- Place for summoning folks (large)
- Bedroom (large)
- Bathroom (large)
- Vault (large), will zap folks who try to use it

#### The Entrance:

Hologram appears upon entering.
>Hello, and welcome to my tower! My name is Phineas Azarel, and if you're using the front door, I'm going to guess that you're not from the College. Please refrain from wandering too much or touching anything you shouldn't. I'll come down to greet you shortly, as soon as I finish whatever experiment or investigation I might be in the middle of. Of course, if I'm dead, none of this matters, so in that case feel free to do as you'd like. My current status is: ALIVE. I am in: THE LIBRARY.

Seems to be mostly a waiting area. Has benches and chairs throughout the room, with paintings and awards along the walls. Small windows 10' or so off the ground (ceiling 20'). Has been converted into a makeshift kobold den, with furs and cloth scattered on the floor. PURPLE FLAME. Four pedestals sit in the corner, with icons for each.
- NW: Fire
- NE: Tree
- SE: Moon
- SW: Thunder Cloud
They each have a divot in them 8" wide, like some kind of spherical object could be placed on top.

## Notes

- Start narration fair distance away from the tower, with surrounding area all drawn out. The party figures out how they want to approach this, which does not involve leading with violence (but does involve being prepared).
	- Everyone except Scan tries to sneak through the grasses, but Friti stumbles and falls into a pit trap and shouts "ah fuck!"
	- The lizardfolk guards fetch some kobolds from inside and send them to investigate the commotion.
	- Realizing the threat, Scan steps out from behind the grasses and introduces himself as a building inspector, here to check the tower. With a use of his Channel Divinity to charm most of the group, he's able to convince them that he's telling the truth.
	- He finds an example stone that has been compressed under the weight of the tower and uses that as evidence that further inspection is required. They let him wander around the outside of the tower (where Etar tries to make a bigger hole) and he continues playing his role.
	- With this evidence, Scan is able to convince the kobolds that the tower could fall any moment, so they all flee. He gets passage into the tower (accompanied by one of the guards) and the rest of the party takes this opportunity to jump on the guard outside.
- The party handles these guards fairly easily, now that they've scared away the kobolds. Scan does get grappled by one of the guards' tails and thrown pretty hard against the far wall.
- Exploring the tower, the party quickly finds themselves at a loss. They are fairly protective of Friti and don't want to let him touch anything. After some experimentation with the pillars in the corner goes nowhere, Etar decides to step on the elevator and tries to command it verbally. Eventually Talia tries to recall if there was anything in the research they had done that could help, and she remembers the name of the device (Locomotion Amplifier, or something to that effect). With that assistance, the party jumps and finds their way onto the second floor.
- Here, they find some 8" and 14" orbs, where the pillars they've seen (including one on this floor) are all 8". One of the orbs is already on the pillar, and they again stumble for a bit trying to figure out how to engage with these orbs.
	- They take them downstairs and try putting them into the correct pillars, but only get a partial reaction.
	- They try taking the elevator up while the orb is powered, but just end up on the roof.
	- Eventually, they let Friti touch the orb, and he follows the plasma ball patterns until his hands cover the top of the orb, and he disappears.
- With some delays (and some assistance from a really good Medicine check), the party manages to repair each of the first three orbs.
- The fourth one had the necromancer (big zombie!) and some undead inside. So the party took care of them, repaired this orb, and put them into place to find their way into the basement.

## Reflections

- Mapping out pre-encounter area, approach is good for all parties. Gives me the basis I need to define things and improvise, gives the players toys to engage with, and reduces confusion about the situation.
- Starting party outside the tower before they engaged was definitely the right move. Allowed them to express agency in how they approached the encounter.
	- Letting players try to sneak up through the tall grass was solid, and giving advantage encouraged even Anna to participate instead of sitting back.
	- Friti failing his stealth check (even with advantage!) and improvising the pit trap was a solid adaptation
	- Unclear whether I should have let Noah get away with more trying to break down the wall with his maul. I don't think so unless he was large - you're not going to put a substantial hole in a massive wall as a dwarf with a maul.
	- Good balance from a rules-first perspective around Channel Divinity: either it's social, at which point I can be flexible with duration/etc., or it's combat and it's serving its mechanical function.
- Letting them scare off the kobolds was a nice partial victory and established what kobolds are like. Fun to play enemies as speaking broken Common.
- Puzzles felt like a bit of a mixed bag, but feedback when explicitly thought was uncritical.
	- Should anticipate the party being much more cautious than I would be - and try to contextualize things in terms of their likely inferences (pedestals are actionable now! is the wizard working with the lizardfolk? he is alive..)
	- Grant felt stuck, but was able to resolve the elevator thing (and guide with the orb piece) by asking if they'd found anything in their research. Invited a roll and an opportunity to sort through things, and it worked out.
	- Players assumed complexity with the plants, too - none of them were anything crazy complicated. Dav asking for direction also helped unblock and is encouraging for giving me an easy opportunity to help them out.
	- *Takeaway: Have puzzles partially completed, partially populated as an indicator of what's supposed to happen.*
- Having a persistent mystery (where the fuck is this wizard? why has nobody heard from him in a few years) seemed to work a bit for persistent engagement.
- Hook for why they were here was not super clear or precise. Didn't have a great answer to what they were hoping for out of it, which meant the party was fairly quick to want to give up.
- Semi-transparent inspirations are good, though maybe could have had more fun obfuscating the ender pearls a bit more visually. Asking about throwing the pearl was a leading question - better to phrase as "it's too tough to just crush in your hands - are you taking a hammer to it? throwing it on the ground?"
	- Dav's reaction to realizing stuff like that is always a good source of entertainment for me, which is important since things aren't always that actively entertaining otherwise.
- It was difficult to come up with a situation that fit my satisfaction, but it paid off - Dav connected some of the smaller details (hologram, what happened to Azarel) after the session and was able to anticipate what's coming next. Was very fun to watch him have that realization.
- Would have been nice to end on the cliffhanger of Leo being abducted, but we'll just have to deal with that next time.
- big zombie was fun, and having him revived with 1hp was funny and had the desired impact (would have been more impactful if anna were paying attention :/ but so be it) without turning the combat too hard.

1342 Autumn 75 - 1342 Winter 4
## Session Description

After finally finding their way out of [[Sefport]], the party hits the open road together for the first time. On their way, they find some monsters and become more familiar with the more rural folk who cover most of the continent.
## Recap

>When last we left our heroes, they had managed to overcome the devilspawn in the offices of the Inspectors and restored the real Elstan to his position as Captain of the Inspectors. With a gift from the Tunnel Snakes and some optimism that the plot to invade Sefport had been adequately disrupted, they headed out toward Laskar, as directed by both their ambitions and the plot of the Black Hand. But of course, the road was not without its trials, as an otherwise peaceful day was broken up by the howling of gnolls ahead...
## On the Road

#### A Gnoll New World

combat!

**Environment:** Small independent settlement, farm with little farmhouse and windmill. Becomes overcast.
People, plants, structures, lighting, and weather.
**Atmosphere:** Unsettling.
**Senses:** Smell the gnolls + dead pigs.
**Events:** There's gnolls.


competing objectives? protecting the people vs. dealing with the archers

4 gnoll abyssal archers to start, arrows whizzing by
4 gnoll marauders start far off, need to dash into range
1 gnoll cackler to start... second might come in late if the first just gets bopped.

more gnolls, then silver blades come in? cocky, looking for a fight

silver blades are a couple of humans, ~35yo - they're having fun in combat! should be bantering
names: clinton (deep, flirtatious, smug, punny) and audrey cross (wears the pants, slightly upshifted, kelli-adjacent vowels, nasal)

peasants: Mary (mother), Rylee (daughter), Gregory (father) Stanley

### Chatting and Winding Down

>"Too polite for Rangers, too eclectic for Caps, too capable for Hounds, and I know you weren't Blades. So, amateurs then? Well done.. for amateurs.

Blades:
- Clinton Cross (deep, flirtatious, smug, punny)
- Audrey Cross (wears the pants, slightly upshifted, kelli-adjacent vowels, nasal)
Peasants:
- Gregory Stanley (father)
- Mary Stanley (mother)
- Rylee Stanley (daughter)

Perspectives:
- blades: protect Wandermere, traverse the local area and deal with monster threats. no contracts, no formal arrangement, just protecting their home and compensated accordingly.
- peasants: stubbornly refused to abandon their farmstead. gregory believed he could protect them and couldn't transport the animals. mary tried to argue they needed to protect their daughter.

blades will inquire about the party - personally, professionally, etc.
probably some chitchat and answering questions
will ultimately offer to escort them and the Stanleys to Wandermere in time for the festival. 

## Festival at Wandermere
![[Pasted image 20250222133201.png]]

thematically: cat, shadow, sleep

market goods: cat ears, moon earring, dollhouse, candies, sun and moon paired stuff

balthazar's bazaar of baubles - conventional carnival barker voice, aggressively pushing souvenirs (middle-aged gnome man)

leader of the town: old dwarf lady Elder Kristryd Daraln

opening ceremony? probably missed given how late in the day it is
footrace
crafts (paper mache?)
battle arena (grappling?)
slapping contest
wood chopping challenge 
obstacle course
drinking contest at the inn (informal) - should have some clear favorite. halfling would be funny. "Gob the vast"
hide and seek (sardines?) "Prowlers"
pin the eyes on the cat
delicacies?
help out waiting tables

any reward? locals should be very into it, clinton and audrey will let loose

## Making it to Laskar

- high-magic vibe compared to what they've experienced so far
- lots of small-scale mages doing tricks etc.
- how does magic infuse moment-to-moment stuff?
## Notes

- Opened with combat! Drew out battle map on tiles, started them reasonably far back since gnolls had the advantage.
- Combat went like 7 rounds, with second wave coming 4-5 rounds in.
- Chat between peasants, Audrey and Clinton Cross, and party. Inquiring about mission, direction, personality.
- Talia tries to run away and hide cleaning up the flowerbed, but Audrey hunts her down. Amusing, in-character, gave chance to roll and see what happens.
- Peasants and Cross couple travel with party to Wandermere, explain basics of the festival.
- Party is assaulted by a merchant in the market as soon as they arrive - Balthazar's Bazaar of Baubles. Talia and Temple each pick up earrings and are lucky enough that they're genuinely blessed.
- Audrey takes the peasants to get cleaned up and prepared, Clinton stays with the party briefly before heading off to do his own thing.
- Etar immediately rushes the drinking contest, with Scan joining in and the party following. Interspersed between other events, loses twice to Gob the Vast before finally taking him down.
- Talia decides to participate in Prowlers (Sardines), immediately selecting the correct place on the map and passing her Perception check to claim a gold medal.
- Whole party participates in paper mache cat-making contest with children. Very close, with whole party sans Etar tying over the head/body/tail rankings. One final roll to decide tiebreaker and Talia claims her second gold medal.
- Talia was interested from the beginning in trying a footrace since she's the fastest and is pretty nimble. Temple and Audrey competed as well, and it was a fascinating fight... for second place. Talia started out in front and never looked back. A child fell in the river but they were fine.
- Talia's three gold medals put her in a convincing first place for the overall festival. Wins the title of Queen of Shadow and a lucky cat that gives effective inspiration once per session for the next three sessions.

## Reflections

- Combat did not go as expected. Thought it would be in the windmill, but the party didn't want to waste a round or two sprinting up and put things in a weird middle-ground instead.
- Seeing Fog Cloud in action was pretty cool, very effectively blocked off the sightline of archers and forced things onto the street.
- MCDM monsters were cool for their unique effects, particularly the movement reduction. Cackler frightened three of the PCs inside the fog cloud since it was based on sound rather than vision.
- Forgot reactions *constantly* - Dav reminded, but seemed to feel weird about it. Was definitely tougher to run mechanically than other combats.
- Should have had gnolls come in farther ahead of Blades - instead ended up with Frosthaven Aesther-style scenario of lots of admin that didn't seem to land (with Dav, at least).
- Tried to include social wind-down before dinner so we would carry the momentum of the combat through what I expected to be a lackluster section. Instead, it dragged due to lack of engagement *and* folks being hungry. Maybe can look to structure things so there's a chance to order dinner and get back into the game while we wait for dinner to happen. Requires belief that engagement will continue.
- I don't think trying to give stakes through dialogue and character is really going to do anything. Have to make things *happen* (sorry Grant's parents) and make the players deal with that.
	- Consequence: I don't think that a group like this is really what I want to be running for long-term. I get excited by engagement and commitment and character, and Noah's the only one who gives me a substantial amount of that here. Grant does okay, but even then I'd really prefer if he were more willing to ask permission to establish things versus not doing anything because he's not sure.
- Festival had some comparison and light mockery comparing to Witchlight (which was on my mind as some pitfalls but not as inspiration, mostly).
	- Wasn't super fond of Dav's negative-toned callbacks, felt like bringing down the vibe for no real reason.
- Events seemed to go well! There were other options for challenges that didn't come through because Etar was focused on taking down Gob the Vast (and taking his chair! *thank you* for taking something I made and *doing something* with it). Didn't make him fight a kid, so I explained the possibility in postgame because I thought the premise was funny enough to bring joy even without execution.
	- **Initial souvenirs:** Fun little character and encounter, set the vibe and folks engaged adequately. Appreciated that both of them got earrings, amused that both were earnestly blessed.
	- **Town map**: Stolen directly from random Reddit post. Shared with party on Discord, gave more than adequate inspiration on which to improvise. Really helpful for hide and seek + race.
	- **Drinking contest**: mechanics and drink names stolen directly from reference document. Not exactly innovative, but certainly did the job and improvising Gob to have adv +4 provided adequate challenge. Perhaps a bit simplistic RP-wise, but Noah made up the difference and made it dynamic by taking Gob's chair. Stuff like that is super impactful for my experience with the game.
	- **Paper mache cat-making contest**: Using children as a way to encourage engagement worked really well, and their added randomization added to the vibe. Maybe could have had total score or head act as tiebreaker, but it worked out. Grant's improvisation really added to it, especially since he happened to have Rylee (the kid they saved)/
	- **Race**: Fully improvised, based heavily on town map. Used a couple different skills, including surprise appearance by pigs at the end. Built confidence in improvisation skills, assuming sufficient support for improvisation. Shortcut over river, pigs at the end were highlights to me.
	- **Hide and Seek**: Figured there should be some tactical decision for seeking to make it feel immersive versus "roll and win". Grant crushed it, so didn't need to develop much complexity. Not super interactive for the party in that I had Grant point to where on the map he wanted to go, but I think it was fine.
- Takeaways:
	- combat good. battle maps good, esp. when drawing details (even meaningless ones). descriptions aren't evocative enough and/or players aren't engaged enough with descriptions, so rely on what works.
		- idea: steal descriptions from havens?
	- character-oriented social encounters don't feel worth it. maybe still good to build world, but it's only dav who i talk to (not even scan, mostly) and that's not very fun.
	- visuals, maps, reference examples in the spirit of what i want are a good basis for improvisation. maybe read lazy dungeon master - steal, steal, steal.
	- party (grant) couldn't tell the difference between what was improvised and what was planned, was impressed at the detail and design. perhaps i can get away with more than i think, as long as i'm improvising mechanics and spend a little time on skeleton vs. improvising visuals

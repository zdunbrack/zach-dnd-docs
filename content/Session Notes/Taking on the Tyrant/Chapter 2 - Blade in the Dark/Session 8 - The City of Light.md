1342 Winter 4 - 1342 Winter 6 (afternoon)
## Session Description

Finally, the party finds their way to [[Laskar]], hoping to find its inhabitants more friendly than the [[Tunnel Snakes|Snakes]] and guilds in [[Sefport]]. They make contact with [[Salvador Hernandez]] of the [[Sunguard]] and with the parents of their own [[Betalia Demacras|Talia Demacras]].
## Recap

>When last we left our heroes, they protected a local farming family from a horde of gnolls with the aid of former Blade members Clinton and Audrey Cross. From there, they travelled with the Cross and Stanley families to the nearby village of Wandermere and celebrated Winter's Eve with the locals. Talia went undefeated in competitions and claimed the title of Queen of Shadow, carrying [[Elzanir]]'s blessing as they finished their otherwise peaceful journey to the gates of [[Laskar]].
## Exploring the City

#### Entering the City

some street encounter (optional)

statue of the twins upon entering. wild-haired lady, hood down, holding fire in her palm on one side of the gate. a hooded figure skulking alongside

maybe just general description
  
A flame, equivalent in brightness to aÂ [torch](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Torch#content), springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn't use oxygen. A continual flame can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.

continual flame
ambient network of magic? perhaps exclusive to mage quarter - ambient prestidigitation
spell salts/crystals instead of scrolls
#### The Demacras Residence

place to take off armor? weapons?

>Talia is light-skinned, blond hair, brown eyed. Wears her hair in a braid that goes down to her waist. Dressed in modest travelling clothes worn under her leather armor

Leo:
- Voice: Neutral pitch, somewhat gravelly, harsh, american vowels ("are you serious?")
- Appearance: Blond, piercing green eyes, straight hair that goes halfway past shoulders. (Lucius Malfoy)
- Dress: red vest over white shirt. crimson pants
- Flavor: Arcana domain, casually shaping light to help with his moment-to-moment tasks.
Aris: 
- Voice: Aspirated, slightly up-pitched, mostly american vowels ("oh, sweetie!")
- Appearance: Brown hair, soft brown eyes, curled hair that stops at shoulders (Kaylee from Firefly)
- Dress: Long purple robe, adorned with symbols of the college
- Flavor: Like Snow White, has bugs (large horned beetles) helping with various tasks and touching visitors
- Research on nature spirits, fae creatures and collaboration between them and humanity. Specifically delved into symbiotic relationships following the loss of Talia's arm.

mother has connection to diviner friend Cailana (female elf), had advanced warning of Talia's arrival.

parents can hook them up with a magic gear contact? maybe takes some time to set up. maybe need to mention the devil first

Leo thinks Talia needs to stand up for herself, develop her assertive voice and forge her own pathway. Disappointed in her failure as a merchant and her giving up. Asks companions in private how vocal and proactive she's been.

Aris thinks Talia is perfectly lovely as she is and will be appreciated by employers and suitable bachelors alike. Nudges lovingly about looking for someone on her travels. Understands if this current objective takes priority, sure it will take her across plenty of the country. Leo sees this as an opportunity as well.
#### Meeting Mr. Hernandez
[[Salvador Hernandez]]

letter is from count nicodemus, has gambling debt.
butler is British elf (anton estevez), served wife's family (nenzune family) for generations. based on leech, says sir/ma'am a lot.
friti is whiny, sounds on the verge of tears. uncooperative.

salvador asked Capital Mail to deliver a letter, but they said they could not locate her. was investigating teleportation relics, maybe ended up on another plane? seems unlikely. college opened up an investigation but to no avail - partially assumed that she's just out there somewhere or hiding her status? unclear.

goal: activate short range teleportation circle at Azarel's Tower? also kid is curious about magical records. trying

## Notes
- Start with entry to city: establish some flavor.
	- Pair of statues
	- Continual flame lights
	- Proper defensive fortifications, massive gate. Line to enter the city.
	- Generally cleaner and nicer than Sefport
- Talia took the lead. Because morning and parents' house is primarily a place to stay, the party started by heading to Salvador's house. No issue, gave Talia a chance to realize that Salvador was the head of the Sunguard, but failed (even with inspiration!)
- Some frustration at Salvador not taking up the mantle and solving their problem for them. He has his own job to do, and these guys still aren't that important. But he will talk to the [[Mage's College]] and see if he can get a lead on locating Azuma... in exchange for the party taking his son Friti to [[Azarel's Tower]] to help him find some research and re-activate 
- With more time before the evening, party heads to library (school library) to see what they can learn about Azarel's tower. Learn his research was about conjuration and teleportation, collaborated with Maria Nenzune Hernandez in investigating "The Eye". After some back-and-forth, learned something about the nature of the monsters in the tower. Had heard of draconic monsters and/or undead, narrowed it down to including lizardmen.
- Finally, they make contact with the Demacras family. Both parents establish personality and familiarize themselves with the party. They take the party over to Highmarket to partially subsidize a magic item (to be ordered and resolved later) each before taking them out to dinner.
- The party picks up Friti at the Nenzune residence and heads out toward Azarel's Tower. On the way, they run into a couple of students trying to capture a sick lightbender with a pit trap, some sedatives, and half of a plan.
	- Talia comes up with the brilliant idea to basically rush the lightbender with a combination of Zephyr Strike, her speed, and Misty Step to inject it with a syringe before it can react. Unfortunately, the lightbender wasn't there! It was actually 30 feet away...
	- Etar quickly grapples it, and the "fight" is under relative control from there once Etar and Talia both roll 14s on a DC14 Wisdom save to avoid being temporarily incapacitated by its blinding flash. They manage to get two sedatives into the creature, with the first severely weakening it and the second taking it down after it took some hits along the way.
	- The two students pulled out a portable cage, which expanded to fit the lightbender, then shrunk back down to be taken back to the town for investigation.
- Finally, the party gets on their way again and makes it to the gates of Azarel's Tower without incident...
## Reflections

- Flavor and worldbuilding worked well. Statues at entrance, continual flame (didn't pay attention to cost but shh it enhanced the themes), magical effects of Mage Quarter were all hits. Allowing any of Thaumaturgy, Prestidigitation, Druidcraft, and Minor Illusion was a fun way of adding a unique flair to \[this part of\] the city. Mage Hand at the restaurant was also nice. 
- Salvador's voice was very well-received. Was hard to switch *away* from the voice (particularly the `th -> ts` replacement), but that failure was all in good fun. Party was following what I was putting down when it came to relations and plot implications.
- Talia's parents were enjoyed as NPCs for what they were. Not exactly groundbreaking, but that was reasonably at Grant's direction. Did not expect the party to unite in trying to give Talia a passing grade - suppose I could have seen that coming, but I didn't. Separating the party, balancing dialogue between everyone, and using both parents independently all worked well.
- Library thing was fine. Had enough information to give them, think it worked out. "The Eye" was a slow improvisation, but it worked. Unclear when I should RP/use NPCs vs. not for stuff like that.
- Some resistance to me not giving information about specifics of monsters in the tower. not a fan of the phrase "if you don't wanna tell us", which I think Grant used but feels emblematic of how the players generally feel about the game. I'm not trying to assess whether I want to tell them, though it can play a part. Mostly, I'd like them to believe the world rather than questioning it.
	- Allowing an investigation check might feel better, or introducing more "no, but". Still frustrating that my relationship with my players isn't authoritative enough and I feel like I have to justify. I understand that difference in expectations can be confusing and I'm not the most confident in my details, but still.
- Combat encounter was different than normal, probably lessons to learn about being more willing to let it be easy.
	- Puzzle-adjacent encounter (that I expected to be more just combat since damage works), Grant said it worked well and was fun to think on a different axis.
	- First attempt at injecting with sedative (improvised, good i think) failed to mirror trick. Absolute perfection, Dav was salty (in fun.. mostly i think) but it's just the situation! Nothing I can do about it at that point!
	- Mixing sedative and combat worked pretty well. Maybe can look to include more puzzle encounters. I do want to run the combats, too, though.
- Anna was paying zero attention a lot of the time and missed a lot of repeated details. Not sure what was up, but not too much I can do about it. Barely noticed during normal gameplay.

## Questions/Ideas

names:
- **artonius**
- **seraphina**
- **valantis**

they have a TA go with them who's like slightly higher level but probably just fuckin dies
he'll be a tank that the school sends with em to round out their group (groups of 4 but not the right number of people)

means i can throw more at the players without it being a huge deal, and it'll be fine if/when he drops (probably gets one-banged by some intimidating foe or after touching the artifact or something)

- intro, admin explains the mission with time limit
- investigate the road - cart toppled over
- road travel is free, able to get to dungeon well enough i think
- five-room goblin dungeon
- something on the road?
- bargnot's dungeon

## Intro

#### Task from the Admin

- human admin, age 53 (f), mrs. barbara cushing. low-energy
- vague description of some artifact, orb that was supposed to be delivered along the road. wasn't well-protected, expresses annoyance that silver blade isn't taking action.
- tells the students that they can meet with an older dwarf student Darius Rockenstone to complete their party - he's been told he needs to be available since the standard number is four, but if they really want to prove themselves then they can leave him here. won't hurt or help their grade directly, but may affect reputation.

#### Meeting with Darius

- find him in the mess hall, unseen servants handling affairs. face-deep in his cups and food
- accent: irish ? deeper, slower
- attitude: not going to drive things, wants them to prove themselves. not interested in stealing their thunder. but happy enough to tag along, always interested in new items. and in fighting.
- vaguely interested in delaying and taking his time, enjoying one more meal.
#### Hitting the Road

- weather (warm, muggy)
- frequent travelers
![[East Aemora.png]]
- what are they doing in camp? in an inn?
- have they ever traveled before?

#### The Cart

![[Aemora.png]]

- travel down toward the swamp for a couple of days, find an overturned cart
- one set of footprints leading away from the cart, no corpses present. some drag marks into the woods
- they find three of the human corpses just off the road, halfway to Alveston
- valuable gem under cart, hard to find
- blood trail?
- can get interrupted if searching the cart too long and suspiciously (recall that swamp is the territory of the red rangers)

#### The Den

- outside: two goblin snipers in the trees, hidden. cave. small skirmish
- two goblin warriors come back to the cave after one round

- inside: small camp. five goblin lackeys, one spinecleaver, two snipers
- plus one warrior

#### Returning Home

- darius actually gets special death cutscene, retcon slightly
	- orb launches behind him and vaporizes goblins to bone, darius screams from the effect but is still breathing heavily.
	- a portal appears revealing dark stone and torchlight. portal is dark and murky with a distinctive (squiggly) red outline.
	- elf steps through the portal - clad in black robes with purple trim, ashen skin and silver hair split across his shoulders. lucius malfoy vibes
	- the orb rolls toward the desk at the back of the room, and the elf picks it up. looks at the orb, says "come home now. what a gift."
	- activates the orb, bones of the goblins glow and disappear with streams of light into the orb, which itself glows with a new energy. from the orb, a bolt of lightning strikes darius and he collapses before his corpse falls into the ground through a new portal - similar to the other in its murkiness and squiggle, but with a gray outline instead of red. portal quickly closes behind, and the elf smiles and disappears.

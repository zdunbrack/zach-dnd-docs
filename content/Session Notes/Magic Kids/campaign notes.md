### general notes

- aasimar: associated with [[Myskili]], parallel to Moonchildren - called Suntouched
- necromancer: kalarel the vile (larkale zamen) - shadar-kai traitor
	- trying to overthrow the raven queen (darius' patron)
	- terrorizing some subset of locals
	- [[Red Rangers]] would love to deal with it, but they're preoccupied with a coven of hags harassing other members of the swamp.
- his brother, keanor zamen tries to steal the orb (name pending) and get it to the mage's college to neutralize it (they won't, but he doesn't know that).
- crumbling keep in the western swamp: https://anyflip.com/hyvsu/idtp
	- encounters on the way there?
- mage's college's interest:
	- know it's powerful
	- got some context from keanor with a request to neutralize it
	- more interested in studying it


darius absolutely comes back in some climactic fashion, temporary or permanent, who knows.

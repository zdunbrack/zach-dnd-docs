## New Directions

#### Returning Home

last thing that happened:
- darius killed queen bargnot, orb launched back and evaporated all the goblins
going forward:
- players now have elf body in cart, human body in cart.
	- other human bodies are intact, hidden in the swamp near the cart.
	- what happened: keanor got paranoid after receiving a threat from kalarel, tried to escape with his package. capital mail tried to do their job and retrieve the package, and keanor slew them for it (easily).
- capital mail:
	- grateful to have corpse(s) returned. allude to the fact that this was an unusual shipment? but policy says that any follow-up is with their point of contact in the mage's college specifically.
- mage's college: 
	- archivist has limited knowledge of what's going on. knows the name of the artifact, knows that they were expecting to receive it. knows handling instructions. archives have more records, but archivist is just responsible for his part of the pipeline (older man, forget race).
		- can accidentally reveal name as Heart of Orcus
	- admin doesn't care. can access records 
		- can accidentally reveal name as Heart of Orcus
		- can access archives and get more information, but reluctant because requires her to do her job. and might hurt their grade, depending on if they're convincing.
	- documents in archives:
		- letter from keanor zamen saying "i've managed to acquire the heart of orcus and would like to bring it to you to be destroyed. i will arrange transport with capital mail and travel with them to get it to you. please confirm"
		- internal dialogue from mage's college basically saying "okay we're saying yes but we're absolutely not destroying it"
			- some speculation as to its power, mention of rumors in the southwest swamp
		- contract with capital mail for insured delivery
- polita:
	- darius has a kind family, fairly conservative around risk. so his behavior was taking that freedom and running with it.

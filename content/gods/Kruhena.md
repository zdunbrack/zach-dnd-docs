**Kruhena** is the goddess of the sea and storms. She and [[Nilhitu]] are the oldest of the gods; it is said that it was their feud that split the world into land and sea. They make up half of the [[Old Gods]], with [[Myskili]] and [[Elzanir]] completing the group.

The Lady of the Waves is not known for her generosity and is generally seen as quite temperamental, just as the ocean. Spring is her season, as the rain and storms invade the land and bring the sea to everyone.

Kruhena herself is usually represented as a mermaid or shark, sometimes with a lightning bolt in hand or fin. She is worshipped mostly by fishermen and sailors, but farmers are known to appeal for an early Spring and strong rains for a good harvest.

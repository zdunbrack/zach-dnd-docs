Sylvaris is the god of cunning, commerce, and ambition. The youngest of the [[New Gods]], Sylvaris's teachings offer a very different perspective to those of [[Gidara]] or [[Raxus]]. While many gods expect deep conviction and devotion, Sylvaris has no such delusions. He will help those who help themselves, whether they have been left behind by society's existing systems or whether they seek to break those systems for their own gain.

The Trickster has many depictions, with most being unfavorable. A snake, fox, or devil are the most common, but some representations show him as a beggar or an outsider among the gods.

The Snake is not just looked to by swindlers and scoundrels - indeed, Sylvaris's guidance is frequently called upon by diplomats and ambassadors to navigate the pitfalls of negotiation. Only by all parties being adequately vigilant can appropriate agreements be arranged. Or so his teachings go.

Starts in [Holburg](Holburg.md), taking on a bounty from the capital.  
Then, get an escort mission from one of the merchants to a nearby town (slightly larger).
 
bounties for dead monster parts? would be funny if it led to the snake problem (india)... kinda like that idea  
after earning some renown, maybe they catch the attention of some bureaucrats. recruited to investigate reports of trouble in the domain of the other place.
 
**figure out what the villain is doing. how are their plans going to affect the heroes or the world?**  
some town they've been to should probably get razed at some point. or at least affected by the changes.
 
general goal: **rebuilding Aemora.** solve the problems of the various regions in the south, find enough stability to allow Zargas to push back against Ikara.  
each region probably has its own issues? inadvertently stumble into the first, then reputation prompts into the rest. heroes just have to answer the call â€“ or not! ideally they would, but we can figure something out if they're not interested. that would be a player discussion though.

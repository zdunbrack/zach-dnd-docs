Taryn the Brave  
Human, died ~10y ago to an unexpected illness (age 66).  
After some tragic backstory (or just ambition), decided to unite the people of Aemora to push back against the wilderness.  
Effort originated from [Zargas](Zargas.md), where he started his political ascent. Spread across the continent, meeting little resistance from the people as he kept them safe.  
Before, was a loosely feudal society where local villages supported local cities in exchange for protection. Mostly worked, but to a lesser degree.  
Taryn set up [[Zargas]]'s government to manage the whole continent and was a great warrior against the forces of evil. Never married nor looked toward succession, hoping that his systems would persevere. The structural systems have, but he always retained military control to prevent a coup and because it was his domain. So with his departure, the guard infrastructure has deteriorated.  
Still some doubt as to whether his death was natural... widely loved but also had enemies, as all ambitious people do.

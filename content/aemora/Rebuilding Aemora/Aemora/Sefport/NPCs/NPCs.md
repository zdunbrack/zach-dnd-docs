**Abalaba Nopenstallen** (f): Lazy gnome, works on behalf of the Capital Council. Not much character depth - entitled, slow, self-interested. Engrossed in her book, but seems to be more focused on ignoring the heroes than actually doing her own thing.

- Description: well-dressed, very nasal voice. hair in a ponytail that sits just over the backing of the chair.
- Characterization inspired by Glint
 
**Ghorza Jaekel** (f): Half-orc investigator, second-in-command of the Inspectors. Catches heroes when turning in their quest, trying to be subtle but she's a 6'6" orc so not very good at it.

- Had the green light to hunt down the tunnel snakes, then was told not to citing safety concerns.
- Stubborn and righteous, but more of an intimidating physical presence than an expert in deception. Competent at investigating and may be inclined to get herself in over her head.
- Description: Tall and imposing, but not directly threatening. Could definitely kick your ass in a fistfight, but will bring you to jail instead.
- Asks that they signal her (figure out how?) when they have info and/or a plan.
 
**Wasp** (f): Human rogue, one of the lieutenants of the Tunnel Snakes. Dealing with mercenaries is one of the more dangerous endeavors, so they send their best. Accompanied by **Scar**, **Nick**, and **Willow**.

- Has a note in pocket with the details of the contract.
- Very confident and abrasive, expects heroes to just comply.
 
**Elstan Siannodel** (m): Elf noble, leader of the Inspectors. Replaced by a doppelganger, imprisoned at Bramble's Barrow.

- Personality: A real leader. Even-keeled, focused on his mission. Takes his job seriously and cares about his people and the people of Sefport. Has some sympathy for the Snakes but not enough to do something about it. All too familiar with the leader of the Snakes.
- Unaware that he's been replaced, asks if Ghorza has taken over in his absence. Has been gone for a few weeks, but doesn't know how long.
 
**Chief** (f): Human rogue, leader of the Tunnel Snakes. Age 27, named Reagan Filigree

- Inspired by Nine-Fingers Keene: believes herself to be righteous, fighting a class war. Carries a lot of disdain for the guilds and the Inspectors. Has some respect for Elstan, but doesn't like him.
- Has a good message about "doing what you have to do", but she has a nice nest egg and does more than is necessary. Takes hatred for the guilds beyond the point of what's practical; can lose sight of what's important in that.

Session overview:

- Establish minor character/flavor details about their stay in the inn - do they socialize at all? Each take their own room? Any sleep rituals? Grant's an elf - what is he doing with the extra time?
- In the morning, **Eldar** catches the heroes before they leave the Captain's Wheel. He gives them their [rewards](Rewards.md) of a couple potions and thanks them again for saving him. He talks with the heroes about things getting worse recently and the sahuagin activity increasing as trade decreased. maybe asks them about what they're going to do and wishes them luck in their travels.
- Heroes head out on the road, establish some rapport. FALL VIBES. Encounter **Wasp** and co. on the road, with Wasp poorly pretending to whittle on a tree stump as cover. roleplay encounter (assuming it happens) where wasp says "yeah just hand over that sealed note and we'll be on our way". presumably leads to combat but who knows. Starts raining on the second half of their walk.
- Heroes arrive in Sefport. Describe the general vibe of the town, probably should see some of the class divide on their walk to the council post. Make it to council post. Deal with **Abalaba Nopenstallen**. she tries to ignore/put off heroes, eventually will ring a bell and pass the note onto some human worker from the back who will go do the actual work and give the party their money. See [Locations](Locations.md) for details.
- Once they make it outside, 6'6" in a massive trenchcoat tries to catch their attention (**Ghorza Jaekel**). Asks them to follow her to a quiet place down an alley. Talks with them briefly about their experience with the Snakes, says she's gotta run and will catch them later. Tells them to see what they can find out but be careful - they're everywhere!
- Some open-ended time in town - they can investigate, get themselves into trouble, do whatever, really. they've got minimal direction and they've got time. probably should find a place to stay.
- Cemetery encounter - see [Train Prep](Train%20Prep.md)

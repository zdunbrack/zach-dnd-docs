INN (dealer's choice):

- a fairly reputable place for merchants, but also includes gambling. suppose i could come up with a gambling game if folks wanted to partake.
- in a town like this, probably has some relationship to the snakes to keep their patrons safe. some kind of protection racket seems believable. maybe show this with the head of the blue shirts (signified how?) coming in and collecting.
- staff won't be particularly inclined to talk about the seedy underbelly of the town, but some kind patron (dwarf, Alberich Broodfist) may overhear and take them to a quiet place. will "recognize them as an old friend" and offer to take them back to his room. can give a civilian's overview of the town and corruption, and perhaps share some rumors. maybe he was even personally affected and has a stake in this.

INN (dark alley):

- basically all locals (not sure how to signify that... reaction when they walk in? some kind of common style/dress, perhaps.
- kind of like showing up at a place you're underdressed for - maybe ignored, maybe technically served but curt answers to all questions.
- seedy place - tended to be the place for sailors, ne'er-do-wells, or just the poor and unfortunate.
- "hole-in-the-wall" in a more literal sense? like someone knocked down part of the foundation of a building and dug out a little are underneath. has "rooms" in the sense of small cubbies with no doors and some bedrolls on the floor.
- probably have the equivalent of "gun behind the counter", maybe some tranquilizing poison? bartender isn't strictly affiliated with either side, probably inclined to curb the violence to the extent possible. should indicate neutrality or exasperation, but not too strongly - it's ambiguous.
- as with the base, probably some slashers in here who will just kind of sit and watch. probably not inclined to fight the players even if they are collateral damage.

GOVERNMENT BUILDING (council post):

- layout reminiscent of bank from bg3
- fairly small front-facing affair, with just a desk off to the side acting as the interface with everything. bulletin board in the back of the room, should have a collection of contracts to establish flavor:
    
    - two-headed giant terrorizing bridge to the west
    - reports of hellspawn to the southwest
    - ogre encampment east of old cross threatening the town
- used to be silver blades' base, so walls include old weapon racks and similar theming (sign)

DUNGEON (sewers, bramble's barrow):

- need a real dungeon map. unclear when, but probably good to have this week.
- skill challenge to navigate sewers?
- proper entrance is in the dark alley, VIP room - need password "tunnel snakes rule" (or some ass-kicking)
- should include a proper (mini-)boss fight
-   
    
 
FOREST (path to bramble's barrow):

- players should come across aftermath of slashers' protection, probably some dead beast/evil
- either need guidance or to navigate the wilderness, could be a skill challenge as well
- should encounter _something_ from the dangerous wilderness directly… could be scavengers on the body of the slashers' target. or just some forest beastie. have some options… but need to figure out how to introduce (and give a chance to dodge?) in a way that feels satisfying and not "well here's a scripted encounter". give agency the whole way thru

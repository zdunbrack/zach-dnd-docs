1342 Autumn 73
## Session Description

The party gets their first taste of blood in a while as they confront the agent of the Black Hand trying to facilitate Sefport's invasion. Then, they depart for Laskar to meet with an old commander from the Silver Blade and foil the Black Hand's plans there.
## Recap

>When last we left our heroes, they had uncovered a conspiracy by the Black Hand to invade Sefport under the guise of a trade agreement. Deftly navigating between the Inspectors and the Tunnel Snakes, the party discovered that the head of the Inspectors was actually a shapeshifter, with the real Elstan sitting in a cell with the Snakes. After Chief revealed that the shapeshifter could read thoughts and therefore would learn what happened from Ghorza, they realized that the jig was up and rushed back to deal with this threat once and for all.

## Taking Care of Business

#### Brawl at the Guild Hall

The party bursts into Ghorza's office with the help of a Silence spell, trying to avoid alerting the Inspectors as to what is happening. They see an armored devil holding her up by the neck, pinning her against the wall. He looks at the door just as it bursts open, and we roll initiative!

Cambion's priorities: summon, cause trouble, get the hell out of there
Summons don't act until following round, seem to mostly be focused on causing chaos.
Ghorza tries to get the fuck out and raise the alarm, can bring in a couple generic guards.

On turn 2, Cambion casts plane shift and gets the hell out of there, probably with some parting words.

>"You are meddling with forces beyond your understanding. Perhaps this little rathole will not yet find its fate, but in time, this entire continent will be one under the Black Hand. Now, if you'll forgive me, I have business to attend to. I recommend you do not interfere. If, that is, you even survive this. Ta-ta!

#### Wrapping Up

After the fight is over, things are a mess. Stuff is on fire, there are probably some charred corpses sitting around, and Ghorza is trying to process what the fuck just happened. 

Is the party going to stick around to help out? Are they heading to make contact with the Snakes? Are they going to take the rest of the evening easy and rest before heading out? Got some loose ends to tie up, hopefully can give closure. Probably mostly looking at a high-level narration and saying "alright that happens and you head out".
## Hitting the Road

#### A Gnoll New World

>You head west from Sefport along the main road, finally moving on toward bigger and better things. It's a familiar path, as you all came this way before you picked up that first contract to find an old elf who disappeared from a small fishing village. That all seems quaint now, after this last week of violence, confusion, and tense negotiations. Each of you had your own journey to get here, but something feels *different*. You've dealt with goblins and orcs before, but devils? Not the kind of company you're used to.
>
>Unlike the last time you went this way, you aren't as worried about keeping an eye out for ambush locations after making your deal with the Tunnel Snakes. So you travel a bit faster, making it past the bridge where some gnolls and a very real two-headed giant were threatening passersby to feed their insatiable hunger.
>
>Even with Winter just around the corner, the weather is fairly pleasant. It's chilly, but skies are clear and there's not much wind, so whatever robes and furs you have on are more than enough to keep you warm as you walk. Every once in a while, you think you hear something shuffling in the trees... but nothing happens, so you keep walking. Probably a bear or something.
>
>After a full day of solid travel, you make it to a small inn at Miller's Junction. Here's where the road splits. North, to the mountains and the capital; and southwest, toward the Great Plain, and eventually, your destination. Your feet are tired, and it's nice to just have a warm bed and a proper meal. 

Party hears howling and hollering in the distance... then screams.

competing objectives? 

4 gnoll abyssal archers to start, arrows whizzing by
4 gnoll marauders start far off, need to dash into range
1 gnoll cackler to start... second might come in late if the first just gets bopped.

more gnolls, then silver blades come in? cocky, looking for a fight

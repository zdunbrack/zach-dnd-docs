**Key Events**:
- make it to to [[Laskar]]
- meet with [[Salvador Hernandez]], get a quest (investigate wizard's tower with his kid?)
- 


**Themes:**
- ***Setting***: big magical city and open plains. dungeons!
- ***Scope***: still regional for now. want to stabilize the region with the silver blades. then next up is the red rangers
- ***Setting Events***: Monsters in the plains are relatively well-handled, but culture is perhaps too ambitious. 
- ***Danger***: moderate
- ***Goals***: Understand what's needed to fight back against the Black Hand. Get buy-in and get going. Stop Laskar from being invaded.
- ***Game Style***: Proving their competency against monsters with violence and adventuring. 
- ***Levity***: Bringing some more reality and darkness into it. Heavier stuff was off-screen before (they *kidnap* people ??) - time to bring it to life.


**Ideas**:

kill one of grant's parents (okay maybe just kidnap them and gloat)

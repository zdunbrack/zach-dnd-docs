**Nilhitu** is the goddess of the wilds and the underground. Her followers believe that she was the first, defining the natural order before [[Kruhena]] split the land with oceans. Then came the sun and the moon, [[Myskili]] and [[Elzanir]], and together the four of them make up the [[Old Gods]].

Autumn is nature's season, as the world enjoys what time it has until winter tests its mettle. The Huntress is not a protector of animals - the natural order includes death and decay as much as life's bounty, and Nilhitu's domain includes all of it.

Elves often find a close connection with Nilhitu, as their long lifespans allow them to appreciate the cyclic aspects of nature and to observe the years from a distance. Creatures of the Underdark also look to Nilhitu for guidance and protection in navigating her treacherous domain.

Nilhitu herself is usually represented as some kind of forest nymph, often with a wreath of flowers on her head. On occasion, though, various wild animals such as a bear or jackal will serve the same role.

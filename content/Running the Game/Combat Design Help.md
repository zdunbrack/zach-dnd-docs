Terrain:
- **Full Cover**  
- **Cover** (going prone becomes more interesting)  
- **Doors** (interactions, allowing player to control the enemies, hodor)  
- **Corridors & Rooms** (the game was designed for dungeon crawl, so open flat areas tips the balance and messes up the front-line dynamic)

- **Difficult Terrain** (Movement speed benefits become more useful)  
- **Height differences** (jumping benefits become more useful)

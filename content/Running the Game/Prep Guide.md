  

# Review any notes from the previous Session.
- Any loose ends that need to get wrapped up?
- Anything that should show up or be mentioned?
- Did the players tell you any of their goals or hopes for the coming session?
# Review the PCs.
- What are they trying to do? 
- What do they want? 
- How can I bring their backgrounds or callback from a previous session into play? 
- What do the players of these characters enjoy at the table?

- **How can I give them interesting decisions?**
# Review or Create NPCs.
**Review:**
- Which NPCs are relevant to this session?
- What are their goals (in reference to their personal desires or fears)?
- How have they made progress towards their goals?
- How do they plan on making progress towards their goals?

**Create:**
For each new NPC you need to make—
- What is 1 distinguishing physical trait (or voice)?
- What is their main desire or fear, and how does it show up in how they behave?
- Do they have any secrets?

	(If they are a bandit, they are also very religious. If they are a Guard Captain, they also care for their sick mother, etc.)

# Create One Evocative Moment
Put it near the beginning to create a hot start.
If it's in the middle or end, prepare to adapt it to player shenanigans.

Set the stage and tone for the session. Bring life and texture to the world.

Try to get to the action! Get to the exciting bit or the drama as soon as you can. Avoid aimlessness or a lack of direction. "Orcs attack!", now deal with it!

Have the moment create an obstacle (see Obstacles section)!
# Outline Potential Scenes
- Make bullet points. 
- Don't get too attached to a particular scene or an outcome of a scene.
- Scenes don't always have to happen in a particular order, but they can.
- Try to create 1 scene for every ~45 minutes of play.

The purpose of scenes is to *make you **feel*** prepared, not necessarily to have every answer to what might happen.

Look for the ins and outs of the scene. How do we get into this scene, and how might it end?
A scene has:
1) **SETUP** (description)
2) **TENSION** (an obstacle in the way)
3) **PAY OFF** (success or failure at overcoming the obstacle, and the following consequences).
# Create Relevant Obstacles
**Obstacles** have **Stakes** (the threat of failure) & **Consequences** (what happens after resolution).
(Consequences can be positive or negative!)

Trust your instincts. What would be fun? What would challenge the PCs?

Give the PCs an imperative or goal that drives their behavior with strong **verbs**:
**Kill, Stop, Steal, Escort, Save, Destroy, Escape, Convince!**
Other weaker verbs like "chase", "find", or "question" should be secondary to the above list.
##### Types of Obstacles
[Big List o' Obstacles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR1i-q-Up9UQc6PJDFTvda7lyLrgx7r04fOZVZoln6Qit3RJFKa4Tld12b2KHpEe1eEDJT0AiX6tWpK/pubhtml)
**Antagonists / Enemies / Rivals**: Someone else creating obstacles of another type in order to stop the party progress.

**Allies / NPCs:** Threats or obstacles to NPCs or other party members.

**Physical**: Impassible place or environment, threats, fights (combat), creatures or monsters, people or objects physically blocking or in the way.

**Monetary / Resource** (often are physical): Lack of or removal of resources. Need X resource to continue.

**Emotional / Internal**: The situation goes against a PC's wants, desires, self-expectations (shoulds), values, or duties. Other examples include fear or moral objections.

**Social / Interpersonal**: People acting in accordance with their beliefs which reflect the ways their culture, society, or relationships compel them (implied or explicit).

**Informational:** Missing information that is required before progressing.

**Intellectual**: Puzzles, decisions, or moral quandaries like no-win scenarios or trolley problems or dichotomies (like collective vs. individual, or passion vs. reason).

**Temporal**: Ticking clocks, deadlines, or needing to wait for a specific time.
# Create the Locations
Scenes that create obstacles happen at particular **locations**!

Search for a piece of art or a map that inspires you.

**Describe your Locations with E.A.S.E. —**
**Environment:** People, plants, structures, lighting, and weather.
**Atmosphere:** What is felt? Evoke emotion (positive, negative, or mixture of both)!
**Senses:** Sight, smell, hearing, touch, temperature, movement. Clear or dull? Fast or slow? 
**Events:** What is happening now within your scene, or what may have happened recently.
# Review or Create Hidden Information
Review any relevant clues, pieces of the story, secrets, or concepts that are not yet revealed to the PCs. Decide if any of them should be revealed this session.

**Clues** are pieces of information created by a Person, Place, or Object. They usually point to another person, place, or piece of information.

Clues can be:
- Tangible (physical)
- Emotional (NPC reaction)
- Behavioral change (NPC)
- Knowledge / Informational / Testimony
- an Artifact / Magic / Technology
- an Absence (something missing)
